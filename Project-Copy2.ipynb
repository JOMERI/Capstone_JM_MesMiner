       " 'As infectious disease outbreaks emerge, public health agencies often enact vaccination and social distancing measures to slow transmission. Their success depends on not only strategies and resources, but also public adherence. Individual willingness to take precautions may be influenced by global factors, such as news media, or local factors, such as infected family members or friends. Here, we compare three modes of epidemiological decision-making in the midst of a growing outbreak using network-based mathematical models that capture plausible heterogeneity in human contact patterns. Individuals decide whether to adopt a recommended intervention based on overall disease prevalence, the proportion of social contacts infected, or the number of social contacts infected. While all strategies can substantially mitigate transmission, vaccinating (or self isolating) based on the number of infected acquaintances is expected to prevent the most infections while requiring the fewest intervention resources. Unlike the other strategies, it has a substantial herd effect, providing indirect protection to a large fraction of the population.',\n",
       " 'This work presents a simple one-pot protocol to achieve core-doped shell nanohybrids comprising silver nanoparticles, curcumin and thermoresponsive polymeric shell taking advantage of the reducing properties of phenolic curcumin substance and its ability to decorate metallic surfaces. Silver nanoparticles were synthesized, via sodium citrate and silver nitrate addition into a boiling aqueous solution of curcumin, monomers and surfactant. Curcumin and sodium citrate promoted silver nucleation, acting as reducing and stabilizing agents. These curcumin-capped AgNPs enabled, after adding the radical polymerization initiator, the assembling of the growing polymer chains around the hydrophobic AgNP surface. The resultant core-doped shell nanohybrids exhibit plasmonic, luminescent and volume thermoresponsive properties, with improved possibilities to be used as successful therapeutic platforms. In fact, the possibility to nanoconfine the synergistic antioxidant, antiviral, antibacterial features of silver and curcumin in one bioavailable hybrid paves the way to promising applications in the biomedical field.',\n",
       " 'Advocates for a One Health approach recognize that global health challenges require multidisciplinary collaborative efforts. While past publications have looked at interdisciplinary competency training for collaboration, few have identified the factors and conditions that enable operational One Health. Through a scoping review of the literature, a multidisciplinary team of researchers analyzed peer-reviewed publications describing multisectoral collaborations around infectious disease-related health events. The review identified 12 factors that support successful One Health collaborations and a coordinated response to health events across three levels: two individual factors (education & training and prior experience & existing relationships), four organizational factors (organizational structures, culture, human resources and, communication), and six network factors (network structures, relationships, leadership, management, available & accessible resources, political environment). The researchers also identified the stage of collaboration during which these factors were most critical, further organizing into starting condition or process-based factors. The research found that publications on multisectoral collaboration for health events do not uniformly report on successes or challenges of collaboration and rarely identify outputs or outcomes of the collaborative process.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Clinical and epidemiological differences between acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that presents at the initiation of mechanical ventilation [MV] (ARDS at MV onset) and that which develops during the course of MV (ARDS after MV onset) are not well understood. We conducted an observational study in five Peruvian ICUs to characterize differences between ARDS at MV onset and after MV onset and identify risk factors for the development of ARDS after MV onset. METHODS: We consecutively enrolled critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure requiring at least 24 h of mechanical ventilation and followed them prospectively during the first 28 days and compared baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes by ARDS status. RESULTS: We enrolled 1657 participants on MV (mean age 60.0 years, 55% males) of whom 334 (20.2%) had ARDS at MV onset and 180 (10.9%) developed ARDS after MV onset. Average tidal volume at the initiation of MV was 8.7 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) for participants with ARDS at MV onset, 8.6 mL/kg PBW for those who developed ARDS after MV onset, and 8.5 mL/kg PBW for those who never developed ARDS (p = 0.23). Overall, 90-day mortality was 56% and 55% for ARDS after MV onset and ARDS at MV onset, respectively, as compared to 46% among those who never developed ARDS (p < 0.01). Adults with ARDS had a higher body mass index (BMI) than those without ARDS (27.3 vs 26.5 kg/m(2), p < 0.01). Higher peak pressure (adjusted interquartile OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.21â\\x80\\x931.88), higher mean airway pressure (adjusted interquartile OR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.13â\\x80\\x931.76), and higher positive end-expiratory pressure (adjusted interquartile OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.10â\\x80\\x931.50) at MV onset were associated with a higher odds of developing ARDS after MV onset. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of mechanically ventilated patients, 31% of study participants had ARDS at some point during their ICU stay. Optimal lung-protective ventilation was not used in a majority of patients. Patients with ARDS after MV onset had a similar 90-day mortality as those with ARDS at MV onset. Higher airway pressures at MV onset, higher PEEP, and higher BMI were associated with the development of ARDS after MV onset.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of aging individuals with chronic co-morbidities travel to regions where falciparum malaria is endemic. Non-communicable diseases are now leading risk factors for death in such countries. Thus, the influence of chronic diseases on the outcome of falciparum malaria is an issue of major importance. Aim of the present study was to assess whether non-communicable diseases increase the risk for severe imported falciparum malaria. METHODS: A retrospective observational study of all adult cases with imported falciparum malaria hospitalized between 2001 and 2015 in the tertiary care CharitÃ© University Hospital, Berlin, was performed. RESULTS: A total of 536 adult patients (median age 37 years; 31.3% female) were enrolled. Of these, 329 (61.4%) originated from endemic countries, 207 patients (38.6%) from non-endemic regions. Criteria for severe malaria were fulfilled in 68 (12.7%) cases. With older age, lack of previous malaria episodes, being a tourist, and delayed presentation, well-characterized risk factors were associated with severe malaria in univariate analysis. After adjustment for these potential confounders hypertension (adjusted odds ratio aOR, 3.06 95% confidence interval, CI 1.34â\\x80\\x937.02), cardiovascular diseases (aOR, 8.20 95% CI 2.30â\\x80\\x9329.22), and dyslipidaemia (aOR, 6.08 95% CI 1.13â\\x80\\x9332.88) were individual diseases associated with severe disease in multivariable logistic regression.

       " 'BACKGROUND: There is a marked paucity of data concerning AKI in Sub-Saharan Africa, where there is a substantial burden of trauma and HIV. METHODS: Prospective data was collected on all patients admitted to a multi-disciplinary ICU in South Africa during 2017. Development of AKI (before or during ICU admission) was recorded and renal recovery 90 days after ICU discharge was determined. RESULTS: Of 849 admissions, the mean age was 42.5 years and mean SAPS 3 score was 48.1. Comorbidities included hypertension (30.5%), HIV (32.6%), diabetes (13.3%), CKD (7.8%) and active tuberculosis (6.2%). The most common reason for admission was trauma (26%). AKI developed in 497 (58.5%). Male gender, illness severity, length of stay, vasopressor drugs and sepsis were independently associated with AKI. AKI was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate of 31.8% vs 7.23% in those without AKI. Age, active tuberculosis, higher SAPS 3 score, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support and sepsis were associated with an increased adjusted odds ratio for death. HIV was not independently associated with AKI or hospital mortality. CKD developed in 14 of 110 (12.7%) patients with stage 3 AKI; none were dialysis-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective multidisciplinary ICU cohort of younger patients, AKI was common, often associated with trauma in addition to traditional risk factors and was associated with good functional renal recovery at 90 days in most survivors. Although the HIV prevalence was high and associated with higher mortality, this was related to the severity of illness and not to HIV status per se.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in awake, spontaneously breathing and non-intubated patients (awake ECMO) may be a novel therapeutic strategy for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and safety of awake ECMO in severe ARDS patients receiving prolonged ECMO (> 14 days). METHODS: We describe our experience with 12 consecutive severe ARDS patients (age, 39.1 Â± 16.4 years) supported with awake ECMO to wait for native lung recovery during prolonged ECMO treatment from July 2013 to January 2018. Outcomes are reported including the hospital mortality, ECMO-related complications and physiological data on weaning from invasive ventilation. RESULTS: The patients received median 26.0 (15.5, 64.8) days of total ECMO duration in the cohort. The longest ECMO support duration was 121 days. Awake ECMO and extubation was implemented after median 10.2(5.0, 42.9) days of ECMO. Awake ECMO was not associated with increased morbidity. The total invasive ventilation duration, lengths of stay in the ICU and hospital in the cohort were 14.0(12.0, 37.3) days, 33.0(22.3, 56.5) days and 46.5(27.3, 84.8) days, respectively. The hospital mortality rate was 33.3% (4/12) in the cohort. Survivors had more stable respiratory rate and heart rate after extubation when compared to the non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: With carefully selected patients, awake ECMO is a feasible and safe strategy for severe pulmonary ARDS patients receiving prolonged ECMO support to wait for native lung recovery.',\n",

The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of these retroviruses in domestic cats in Hungary and to characterise the phylogenetic relationships of FIV strains. METHODS: A total of 335 anticoagulated whole-blood samples obtained from both a healthy and ill cat population were examined for the presence of FIV and FeLV with two methods: ELISA and PCR. Statistical analysis was carried out to analyse the data obtained. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of partial polymerase (pol) gene sequences was performed to describe circulating FIV subtypes. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed 11.8% and 9.9% true prevalence of FeLV and FIV, respectively, with ELISA. The apparent prevalence calculated from the PCR results were 17.3% for FeLV and 13.1% for FIV. Phylogenetic analysis of partial pol gene sequences obtained from 22 FIV strains showed that all observed Hungarian strains belonged to FIV subtype B. The strains were grouped into several monophyletic subgroups reflecting the geographic locations of the origin of the samples. The overall mean genetic similarity between the analysed strains was 98.2%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We report the first thorough overview of the prevalence of FeLV and FIV in Hungary, which is relatively high, and give insight into the genetic diversity of Hungarian strains of FIV.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreaks, while sporadic, cause tremendous morbidity and mortality. No therapeutics or vaccines are currently licensed; however, a vaccine has shown promise in clinical trials. A critical step towards development of effective therapeutics is a better understanding of factors that govern host susceptibility to this pathogen. As macrophages are an important cell population targeted during virus replication, we explore the effect of cytokine polarization on macrophage infection. METHODS/MAIN FINDINGS: We utilized a BSL2 EBOV model virus, infectious, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding EBOV glycoprotein (GP) (rVSV/EBOV GP) in place of its native glycoprotein. Macrophages polarized towards a M2-like anti-inflammatory state by combined IL-4 and IL-13 treatment were more susceptible to rVSV/EBOV GP, but not to wild-type VSV (rVSV/G), suggesting that EBOV GP-dependent entry events were enhanced by these cytokines. Examination of RNA expression of known surface receptors that bind and internalize filoviruses demonstrated that IL-4/IL-13 stimulated expression of the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN in human macrophages and addition of the competitive inhibitor mannan abrogated IL-4/IL-13 enhanced infection. Two murine DC-SIGN-like family members, SIGNR3 and SIGNR5, were upregulated by IL-4/IL-13 in murine macrophages, but only SIGNR3 enhanced virus infection in a mannan-inhibited manner, suggesting that murine SIGNR3 plays a similar role to human DC-SIGN. In vivo IL-4/IL-13 administration significantly increased virus-mediated mortality in a mouse model and transfer of ex vivo IL-4/IL-13-treated murine peritoneal macrophages into the peritoneal cavity of mice enhanced pathogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE: These studies highlight the ability of macrophage polarization to influence EBOV GP-dependent virus replication in vivo and ex vivo, with M2a polarization upregulating cell surface receptor expression and thereby enhancing virus replication. Our findings provide an increased understanding of the host factors in macrophages governing susceptibility to filoviruses and identify novel murine receptors mediating EBOV entry.',\n",

The subjectsâ\\x80\\x99 cardiorespiratory physiological measurements were assessed in different states of physical activity under different interventions (mask without and with MF). A total of 106 subjects were recruited between July-August 2016. The use of the mask without MF increased the End-Tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)) and Fractional concentration of Inspired CO(2) (FICO(2)) at rest and on mild exertion, as expected. The use of the mask with MF brought FICO(2) levels comparably closer to baseline levels without the mask for both activities. The mask, with or without the MF, was found to be well fitting, comfortable and safe for use in children at rest and on mild exertion. The N95 mask tested offers a promising start for more studies in the paediatric population.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Pristine carbon dots (CDs) derived from citric acid pyrolysis are used in a variety of biomedical research such as imaging and drug delivery. However, potential cytotoxic effects of pyrolysis temperature on cells is underexplored. To address this need, we studied toxicity of the CDs to breast cancer cells using MTT and LDH assays. In addition, we investigated photo-induced cytotoxicity of the synthesized CDs in a wide concentration range under white light. RESULTS: Our results suggest little cytotoxicity of the CDs after 24 h exposure of cells. Only the high quantum yield CDs caused a significant toxicity to cells at the highest concentrations of 2.0 and 1.5 mg/ml compared to other CDs at similar concentrations. The synthesized CDs entered the cells without any significant cytotoxicity. The CDs also caused a concentration- and irradiation time-dependent photo-induced cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION: The optimization of synthesis conditions from this study may help develop safe and efficient CDs for imaging and drug delivery.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is an autoimmune disease that carries a high mortality. Very few case reports in the literature have described a relationship between Graves disease and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We present a case of a patient with Graves disease who was found to be biochemically and clinically hyperthyroid with concurrent thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 30-year-old African American woman with a history of hypertension and a family history of Graves disease who had recently been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and placed on methimazole. She presented to our hospital with the complaints of progressive shortness of breath and dizziness. Her vital signs were stable. On further evaluation, she was diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, depending on clinical and laboratory results, and also was found to have highly elevated free T4 and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone. She received multiple sessions of plasmapheresis and ultimately had a total thyroidectomy. The patientâ\\x80\\x99s hospital course was complicated by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Her platelets stabilized at approximately 50,000/Î¼l, and her ADAMTS13 activity normalized despite multiple complications. The patient ultimately had a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity and died despite multiple attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation. CONCLUSION: Graves disease is an uncommon trigger for the development of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and very few cases have been reported thus far. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of this association in the appropriate clinical context to comprehensively monitor hyperthyroid patients during treatment.',\n",

We have also discussed some general strategies for the discovery of small-molecule ZIKV inhibitors.',\n",
       " 'Npl4 is likely to be the most upstream factor recognizing Lys48-linked polyubiquitylated substrates in the proteasomal degradation pathway in yeast. Along with Ufd1, Npl4 forms a heterodimer (UN), and functions as a cofactor for the Cdc48 ATPase. Here, we report the crystal structures of yeast Npl4 in complex with Lys48-linked diubiquitin and with the Npl4-binding motif of Ufd1. The distal and proximal ubiquitin moieties of Lys48-linked diubiquitin primarily interact with the C-terminal helix and N-terminal loop of the Npl4 C-terminal domain (CTD), respectively. Mutational analysis suggests that the CTD contributes to linkage selectivity and initial binding of ubiquitin chains. Ufd1 occupies a hydrophobic groove of the Mpr1/Pad1 N-terminal (MPN) domain of Npl4, which corresponds to the catalytic groove of the MPN domain of JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme (JAMM)-family deubiquitylating enzyme. This study provides important structural insights into the polyubiquitin chain recognition by the Cdc48â\\x80\\x93UN complex and its assembly.',\n",
       " 'Rotavirus (RV) replicates in round-shaped cytoplasmic viral factories, although how they assemble remains unknown. During RV infection, NSP5 undergoes hyperphosphorylation, which is primed by the phosphorylation of a single serine residue. The role of this posttranslational modification in the formation of viroplasms and its impact on virus replication remain obscure. Here, we investigated the role of NSP5 during RV infection by taking advantage of a modified fully tractable reverse-genetics system. A trans-complementing cell line stably producing NSP5 was used to generate and characterize several recombinant rotaviruses (rRVs) with mutations in NSP5. We demonstrate that an rRV lacking NSP5 was completely unable to assemble viroplasms and to replicate, confirming its pivotal role in rotavirus replication. A number of mutants with impaired NSP5 phosphorylation were generated to further interrogate the function of this posttranslational modification in the assembly of replication-competent viroplasms. We showed that the rRV mutant strains exhibited impaired viral replication and the ability to assemble round-shaped viroplasms in MA104 cells. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation during RV infection using NSP5 phosphorylation-negative rRV strains, as well as MA104-derived stable transfectant cell lines expressing either wild-type NSP5 or selected NSP5 deletion mutants. Our results indicate that NSP5 hyperphosphorylation is a crucial step for the assembly of round-shaped viroplasms, highlighting the key role of the C-terminal tail of NSP5 in the formation of replication-competent viral factories. Such a complex NSP5 phosphorylation cascade may serve as a paradigm for the assembly of functional viral factories in other RNA viruses. IMPORTANCE The rotavirus (RV) double-stranded RNA genome is replicated and packaged into virus progeny in cytoplasmic structures termed viroplasms. The nonstructural protein NSP5, which undergoes a complex hyperphosphorylation process during RV infection, is required for the formation of these virus-induced organelles. However, its roles in viroplasm formation and RV replication have never been directly assessed due to the lack of a fully tractable reverse-genetics (RG) system for rotaviruses. Here, we show a novel application of a recently developed RG system by establishing a stable trans-complementing NSP5-producing cell line required to rescue rotaviruses with mutations in NSP5. This approach allowed us to provide the first direct evidence of the pivotal role of this protein during RV replication. Furthermore, using recombinant RV mutants, we shed light on the molecular mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation during infection and its involvement in the assembly and maturation of replication-competent viroplasms.',\n",
       " 'Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating hypoxemic respiratory failure, characterized by disruption of the alveolar-capillary membrane barrier. Current management for ARDS remains supportive, including lung-protective ventilation and a conservative fluid strategy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a potentially attractive candidate for the management of ARDS through facilitating lung tissue regeneration and repair by releasing paracrine soluble factors. Over the last decade, a variety of strategies have emerged to optimize MSC-based therapy. Among these, the strategy using genetically modified MSCs has received increased attention recently due to its distinct advantage, in conferring incremental migratory capacity and, enhancing the anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, angiogenic, and antifibrotic effects of these cells in numerous preclinical ARDS models, which may in turn provide additional benefits in the management of ARDS. Here, we provide an overview of recent studies testing the efficacy of genetically modified MSCs using preclinical models of ARDS.',\n",
       " 'The mortality rate of hemorrhagic African swine fever (ASF), which targets domestic pigs and wild boars is caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV), can reach 100%. Since the first confirmed ASF outbreak in China on 3 August 2018, 156 ASF outbreaks were detected in 32 provinces. About 1,170,000 pigs were culled in order to halt further spread. There is no effective treatment or vaccine for it and the present molecular diagnosis technologies have trade-offs in sensitivity, specificity, cost and speed, and none of them cater perfectly to ASF control. Thus, a technology that overcomes the need for laboratory facilities, is relatively low cost, and rapidly and sensitively detects ASFV would be highly valuable. Here, we describe an RAA-Cas12a-based system that combines recombinase aided amplification (RAA) and CRISPR/Cas12a for ASFV detection. The fluorescence intensity readout of this system detected ASFV p72 gene levels as low as 10 aM. For on-site ASFV detection, lateral-flow strip readout was introduced for the first time in the RAA-Cas12a based system (named CORDS, Cas12a-based On-site and Rapid Detection System). We used CORDS to detect target DNA highly specifically using the lateral-flow strip readout and the assay displayed no cross-reactivity to other 13 swine viruses including classical swine fever (CSF). CORDS could identify the ASFV DNA target at femtomolar sensitivity in an hour at 37Â°C, and only requires an incubator. For ease of use, the reagents of CORDS were lyophilized to three tubes and remained the same sensitivity when stored at 4Â°C for at least 7 days. Thus, CORDS provide a rapid, sensitive and easily operable method for ASFV on-site detection. Lyophilized CORDS can withstand long-term transportation and storage, and is ready for field-based applications.',\n",
       " 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum is the agent of tick-borne fever, equine, canine and human granulocytic anaplasmosis. The common route of A. phagocytophilum transmission is through a tick bite, the main vector in Europe being Ixodes ricinus. Despite the apparently ubiquitous presence of the pathogen A. phagocytophilum in ticks and various wild and domestic animals from Europe, up to date published clinical cases of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) remain rare compared to the worldwide status. It is unclear if this reflects the epidemiological dynamics of the human infection in Europe or if the disease is underdiagnosed or underreported. Epidemiologic studies in Europe have suggested an increased occupational risk of infection for forestry workers, hunters, veterinarians, and farmers with a tick-bite history and living in endemic areas. Although the overall genetic diversity of A. phagocytophilum in Europe is higher than in the USA, the strains responsible for the human infections are related on both continents. However, the study of the genetic variability and assessment of the difference of pathogenicity and infectivity between strains to various hosts has been insufficiently explored to date. Most of the European HGA cases presented as a mild infection, common clinical signs being pyrexia, headache, myalgia and arthralgia. The diagnosis of HGA in the USA was recommended to be based on clinical signs and the patientâ\\x80\\x99s history and later confirmed using specialized laboratory tests. However, in Europe since the majority of cases are presenting as mild infection, laboratory tests may be performed before the treatment in order to avoid antibiotic overuse. The drug of choice for HGA is doxycycline and because of potential for serious complication the treatment should be instituted on clinical suspicion alone.',\n",
       " 'Tick-borne nairoviruses (order Bunyavirales) encode an ovarian tumor domain protease (OTU) that suppresses the innate immune response by reversing the post-translational modification of proteins by ubiquitin (Ub) and interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15). Ub is highly conserved across eukaryotes, whereas ISG15 is only present in vertebrates and shows substantial sequence diversity. Prior attempts to address the effect of ISG15 diversity on viral protein-ISG15 interactions have focused on only a single speciesâ\\x80\\x99 ISG15 or a limited selection of nairovirus OTUs. To gain a more complete perspective of OTU-ISG15 interactions, we biochemically assessed the relative activities of 14 diverse nairovirus OTUs for 12 speciesâ\\x80\\x99 ISG15 and found that ISG15 activity is predominantly restricted to particular nairovirus lineages reflecting, in general, known virus-host associations. To uncover the underlying molecular factors driving OTUs affinity for ISG15, X-ray crystal structures of Kupe virus and Ganjam virus OTUs bound to sheep ISG15 were solved and compared to complexes of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Erve virus OTUs bound to human and mouse ISG15, respectively. Through mutational and structural analysis seven residues in ISG15 were identified that predominantly influence ISG15 species specificity among nairovirus OTUs. Additionally, OTU residues were identified that influence ISG15 preference, suggesting the potential for viral OTUs to adapt to different host ISG15s. These findings provide a foundation to further develop research methods to trace nairovirus-host relationships and delineate the full impact of ISG15 diversity on nairovirus infection.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Herpesviridae reactivation among non-immunocompromised critically ill patients is associated with impaired prognosis, especially during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, little is known about herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation occurring in patients with severe ARDS under veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We tried to determine the frequency of Herpesviridae reactivation and its impact on patientsâ\\x80\\x99 prognosis during ECMO for severe ARDS. RESULTS: During a 5-year period, 123 non-immunocompromised patients with a severe ARDS requiring a veno-venous ECMO were included. Sixty-seven patients (54%) experienced HSV and/or CMV reactivation during ECMO course (20 viral co-infection, 40 HSV alone, and 7 CMV alone). HSV reactivation occurred earlier than CMV after the beginning of MV [(6â\\x80\\x9315) vs. 19 (13â\\x80\\x9329) days; p < 0.01] and after ECMO implementation [(2â\\x80\\x938) vs. 14 (10â\\x80\\x9320) days; p < 0.01]. In univariate analysis, HSV/CMV reactivation was associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation [(22â\\x80\\x9352.5) vs. 17.5 (9â\\x80\\x9328) days; p < 0.01], a longer duration of ECMO [15 (10â\\x80\\x9322.5) vs. 9 (5â\\x80\\x9314) days; p < 0.01], and a prolonged ICU [29 (19.5â\\x80\\x9347.5) vs. 16 (9â\\x80\\x9330) days; p < 0.01] and hospital stay [44 (29â\\x80\\x9363.5) vs. 24 (11â\\x80\\x9343) days; p < 0.01] as compared to non-reactivated patients. However, in multivariate analysis, viral reactivation remained associated with prolonged MV only. When considered separately, both HSV and CMV reactivation were associated with a longer duration of MV as compared to non-reactivation patients [29 (19.5â\\x80\\x9341) and 28 (20.5â\\x80\\x9337), respectively, vs. 17.5 (9â\\x80\\x9328) days; p < 0.05]. Co-reactivation patients had a longer duration of MV [58.5 (38â\\x80\\x9372.3); p < 0.05] and ICU stay [51.5 (32.5â\\x80\\x9369) vs. 27.5 (17.75â\\x80\\x9335.5) and 29 (20â\\x80\\x9330.5), respectively] as compared to patients with HSV or CMV reactivation alone. In multivariate analysis, HSV reactivation remained independently associated with a longer duration of MV and hospital length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Herpesviridae reactivation is frequent among patients with severe ARDS under veno-venous ECMO and is associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation. The direct causative link between HSV and CMV reactivation and respiratory function worsening under ECMO remains to be confirmed.',\n",
       " 'Influenza is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, as well as in China. Knowledge of the spatial and temporal characteristics of influenza is important in evaluating and developing disease control programs. This study aims to describe an accurate spatiotemporal pattern of influenza at the prefecture level and explore the risk factors associated with influenza incidence risk in mainland China from 2005 to 2018. The incidence data of influenza were obtained from the Chinese Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting System (CNIDRS). The Besag York MolliÃ© (BYM) model was extended to include temporal and space-time interaction terms. The parameters for this extended Bayesian spatiotemporal model were estimated through integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) using the package R-INLA in R. A total of 702,226 influenza cases were reported in mainland China in CNIDRS from 2005â\\x80\\x932018. The yearly reported incidence rate of influenza increased 15.6 times over the study period, from 3.51 in 2005 to 55.09 in 2008 per 100,000 populations. The temporal term in the spatiotemporal model showed that much of the increase occurred during the last 3 years of the study period. The risk factor analysis showed that the decreased number of influenza vaccines for sale, the new update of the influenza surveillance protocol, the increase in the rate of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 among all processed specimens from influenza-like illness (ILI) patients, and the increase in the latitude and longitude of geographic location were associated with an increase in the influenza incidence risk. After the adjusting for fixed covariate effects and time random effects, the map of the spatial structured term shows that high-risk areas clustered in the central part of China and the lowest-risk areas in the east and west. Large space-time variations in influenza have been found since 2009. In conclusion, an increasing trend of influenza was observed from 2005 to 2018. The insufficient flu vaccine supplements, the newly emerging influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and expansion of influenza surveillance efforts might be the major causes of the dramatic changes in outbreak and spatio-temporal epidemic patterns. Clusters of prefectures with high relative risks of influenza were identified in the central part of China. Future research with more risk factors at both national and local levels is necessary to explain the changing spatiotemporal patterns of influenza in China.',\n",
       " 'Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection can induce intestinal dysfunction, resulting in severe diarrhea and even death, but the mode of action underlying these viral effects remains unclear. This study determined the effects of PEDV infection on intestinal absorption and the expression of genes for nutrient transporters via biochemical tests and microarray analysis. Sixteen 7-day-old healthy piglets fed a milk replacer were randomly allocated to one of two groups. After 5-day adaption, piglets (n = 8/group) were orally administrated with either sterile saline or PEDV (the strain from Yunnan province) at 10(4.5) TCID(50) (50% tissue culture infectious dose) per pig. All pigs were orally infused D-xylose (0.1 g/kg BW) on day 5 post PEDV or saline administration. One hour later, jugular vein blood samples as well as intestinal samples were collected for further analysis. In comparison with the control group, PEDV infection increased diarrhea incidence, blood diamine oxidase activity, and iFABP level, while reducing growth and plasma D-xylose concentration in piglets. Moreover, PEDV infection altered plasma and jejunal amino acid profiles, and decreased the expression of aquaporins and amino acid transporters (L-type amino acid transporter 1, sodium-independent amino acid transporter, B(Â°(,+))-type amino acid transport protein, sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter 1, sodium-dependent glutamate/aspartate transporter 3, and peptide transporter (1), lipid transport and metabolism-related genes (lipoprotein lipase, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein A4, apolipoprotein C2, solute carrier family 27 member 2, solute carrier family 27 member 4, fatty acid synthase, and long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (3), and glucose transport genes (glucose transporter-2 and insulin receptor) in the jejunum. However, PEDV administration increased mRNA levels for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, argininosuccinate synthase 1, sodium/glucose co-transporter-1, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in the jejunum. Collectively, these comprehensive results indicate that PEDV infection induces intestinal injury and inhibits the expression of genes encoding for nutrient transporters.',\n",
       " 'Chronic kidney disease is an epidemiologically identified risk factor for development of severe dengue in dengue-affected patients. However, available data on the immune pathogenesis in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients affected by dengue is insufficient. We performed an in vitro study to evaluate the sequential immunological reactions and viral load in dengue virus type 2-infected mononuclear cells of patients with ESRD (n = 34) and in healthy controls (n = 30). The concentrations of interleukins (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (Ra), IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1b (MIP-1b), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± and viral load cycle threshold (Ct) were measured in the dengue virus type 2-infected mononuclear cells at 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection. We found in the ESRD group significantly higher GM-CSF and IL-2 levels at 6 h post-infection. However, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-Î±, MCP-1, and MIP-1b levels were found significantly lower than in the control group. At 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection, significantly lower levels of IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-Î±, MCP-1, and MIP-1b were detected in ESRD group. Concentration of VEGF at 24 h and 48 h, and of GM-CSF at 48 h and 72 h were also found to be lower in ESRD group than in control group. Compared with controls, the viral load Ct values were significantly lower in ESRD group at 6 h and 24 h post-infection No significant difference in viral load Ct values between two groups was found at 48 h and 72 h post-infection. Our study discloses that the expression of immune mediators of dengue-infected mononuclear cells is impaired in ESRD patients.',\n",

However, existing RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms cannot predict the pseudoknot structure efficiently. Although random matching can improve the number of base pairs, these non-consecutive base pairs cannot make contributions to reduce the free energy. RESULT: In order to improve the efficiency of searching procedure, our algorithm take consecutive base pairs as the basic components. Firstly, our algorithm calculates and archive all the consecutive base pairs in triplet data structure, if the number of consecutive base pairs is greater than given minimum stem length. Secondly, the annealing schedule is adapted to select the optimal solution that has minimum free energy. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated with the real instances in PseudoBase.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Telocytes (TCs) are newly identified interstitial cells that participate in tissue protection and repair. The present study investigated the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of TCs in a mouse model of respiratory distress. METHODS: The mouse model of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was established by intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After instillation of TCs culture medium, lung injury was assessed, and angiogenesis markers, including CD31 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), were detected by immunofluorescence. Bioinformatics analysis was used to screen significantly differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in cultured TCs stimulated with LPS, and the regulation of downstream angiogenesis genes by these miRNAs was analysed and verified. PI3K subunits and pathways were evaluated by using a PI3K p110Î± inhibitor to study the involved mechanisms. RESULTS: In ARDS mice, instillation of TCs culture medium ameliorated LPS-induced inflammation and lung injury and increased the protein levels of CD31 and eNOS in the injured lungs. A total of 7 miRNAs and 1899 mRNAs were differentially regulated in TCs stimulated with LPS. Functional prediction analysis showed that the differentially expressed mRNAs were enriched in angiogenesis-related processes, which were highly correlated with miR-21a-3p. Culture medium from TCs with miR-21a-3p inhibition failed to promote angiogenesis in mouse models of LPS-induced ARDS. In cultured TCs, LPS stimulation upregulated the expression of miR-21a-3p, which further targeted the transcription factor E2F8 and decreased Notch2 protein expression. TCs culture medium enhanced hemangioendothelioma endothelial cells (EOMA cells) proliferation, which was blocked by the miR-21a-3p inhibitor. The PI3K p110Î± inhibitor decreased vascular endothelial growth factor levels in LPS-stimulated TCs and reversed the enhancing effect of TCs culture medium on EOMA cells proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: TCs exerted protective effects under inflammatory conditions by promoting angiogenesis via miR-21a-3p. The PI3K p110Î± subunit and transcriptional factor E2F8 could be involved in this process.',\n",
       " 'We monitored the survival of human pathogenic bacteria [Escherichia coli (ATCC), extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase-producing E. coli (Clinical isolate), New Delhi metallo-Î²-lactamase-producing E. coli (clinical isolate), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC)] on dry materials (vinyl chloride, aluminum, plastic, stainless steel) at distinct temperatures (room temperature or 15Â°Câ\\x80\\x9337Â°C). These bacteria favored a lower temperature for their prolonged survival on the dry fomites, regardless of the material type. Interestingly, when mixed with S. aureus, E. coli survived for a longer time at a lower temperature. Cardiolipin, which can promote the survival of S. aureus in harsh environments, had no effect on maintaining the survival of E. coli. Although the trends remained unchanged, adjusting the humidity from 40% to 60% affected the survival of bacteria on dry surfaces. Scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed no morphological differences in these bacteria immediately before or after one day of dry conditions. In addition, ATP assessment, a method used to visualize high-touch surfaces in hospitals, was not effective at monitoring bacterial dynamics. A specialized handrail device fitted with a heater, which was maintained at normal human body core temperature, successfully prohibited the prolonged survival of bacteria [Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC), E. coli (ATCC), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC), S. aureus (ATCC), Acinetobacter baumannii (clinical isolate), and Serratia marcescens (clinical isolate)], with the exception of spore-forming Bacillus subtilis (from our laboratory collection) and the yeast-like fungus Candida albicans (from our laboratory collection)] on dry surfaces. Taken together, we concluded that the tested bacteria favor lower temperatures for their survival in dry environments. Therefore, the thermal control of dry fomites has the potential to control bacterial survival on high-touch surfaces in hospitals.',\n",
       " 'During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Western Africa (2013â\\x80\\x922016), antimalarial treatment was administered to EVD patients due to the high coexisting malaria burden in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. In an Ebola treatment center in Liberia, EVD patients receiving the combination antimalarial artesunate-amodiaquine had a lower risk of death compared to those treated with artemether-lumefantrine. As artemether and artesunate are derivatives of artemisinin, the beneficial anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) effect observed could possibly be attributed to the change from lumefantrine to amodiaquine. Amodiaquine is a widely used antimalarial in the countries that experience outbreaks of EVD and, therefore, holds promise as an approved drug that could be repurposed for treating EBOV infections. We investigated the potential anti-EBOV effect of amodiaquine in a well-characterized nonhuman primate model of EVD. Using a similar 3-day antimalarial dosing strategy as for human patients, plasma concentrations of amodiaquine in healthy animals were similar to those found in humans. However, the treatment regimen did not result in a survival benefit or decrease of disease signs in EBOV-infected animals. While amodiaquine on its own failed to demonstrate efficacy, we cannot exclude potential therapeutic value of amodiaquine when used in combination with artesunate or another antiviral.',\n",
       " 'Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is currently one of the major concerns in human public health due to its association with neurological disorders. Intensive effort has been implemented for the treatment of ZIKV, however there are not currently approved vaccines or antivirals available to combat ZIKV infection. In this sense, the identification of virulence factors associated with changes in ZIKV virulence could help to develop safe and effective countermeasures to treat ZIKV or to prevent future outbreaks. Here, we have compared the virulence of two related ZIKV strains from the recent outbreak in Brazil (2015), Rio Grande do Norte Natal (RGN) and Paraiba. In spite of both viruses being identified in the same period of time and region, significant differences in virulence and replication were observed using a validated mouse model of ZIKV infection. While ZIKV-RGN has a 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD(50)) of ~10(5) focus forming units (FFUs), ZIKV-Paraiba infection resulted in 100% of lethality with less than 10 FFUs. Combining deep-sequencing analysis and our previously described infectious ZIKV-RGN cDNA clone, we identified a natural polymorphism in the non-structural protein 2 A (NS2A) that increase the virulence of ZIKV. Moreover, results demonstrate that the single amino acid alanine to valine substitution at position 117 (A117V) in the NS2A was sufficient to convert the attenuated rZIKV-RGN in a virulent Paraiba-like virus (MLD(50) < 10 FFU). The mechanism of action was also evaluated and data indicate that substitution A117V in ZIKV NS2A protein reduces host innate immune responses and viral-induced apoptosis in vitro. Therefore, amino acid substitution A117V in ZIKV NS2A could be used as a genetic risk-assessment marker for future ZIKV outbreaks.',\n",
       " 'Influenza is a major global public health threat as a result of its highly pathogenic variants, large zoonotic reservoir, and pandemic potential. Metagenomic viral sequencing offers the potential for a diagnostic test for influenza virus which also provides insights on transmission, evolution, and drug resistance and simultaneously detects other viruses. We therefore set out to apply the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing method to metagenomic sequencing of respiratory samples. We generated influenza virus reads down to a limit of detection of 10(2) to 10(3) genome copies/ml in pooled samples, observing a strong relationship between the viral titer and the proportion of influenza virus reads (P = 4.7 Ã\\x97 10(â\\x88\\x925)). Applying our methods to clinical throat swabs, we generated influenza virus reads for 27/27 samples with mid-to-high viral titers (cycle threshold [C(T)] values, <30) and 6/13 samples with low viral titers (C(T) values, 30 to 40). No false-positive reads were generated from 10 influenza virus-negative samples. Thus, Nanopore sequencing operated with 83% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 67 to 93%) and 100% specificity (95% CI, 69 to 100%) compared to the current diagnostic standard. Coverage of full-length virus was dependent on sample composition, being negatively influenced by increased host and bacterial reads. However, at high influenza virus titers, we were able to reconstruct >99% complete sequences for all eight gene segments. We also detected a human coronavirus coinfection in one clinical sample. While further optimization is required to improve sensitivity, this approach shows promise for the Nanopore platform to be used in the diagnosis and genetic analysis of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Telocytes (TCs) have the capacity of cellâ\\x80\\x93cell communication with adjacent cells within the tissue, contributing to tissue repair and recovery from injury. The present study aims at investigating the molecular mechanisms by which the TGFÎ²1-ITGB1-PI3K signal pathways regulate TC cycle and proliferation. METHODS: Gene expression of integrin (ITG) family were measured in mouse primary TCs to compare with other cells. TC proliferation, movement, cell cycle, and PI3K isoform protein genes were assayed in ITGB1-negative or positive mouse lung TCs treated with the inhibition of PI3Kp110Î±, PI3KÎ±/Î´, PKCÎ², or GSK3, followed by TGFÎ²1 treatment. RESULTS: We found the characters and interactions of ITG or PKC family member networks in primary mouse lung TCs, different from other cells in the lung tissue. The deletion of ITGB1 changed TCs sensitivity to treatment with multifunctional cytokines or signal pathway inhibitors. The compensatory mechanisms occur among TGFÎ²1-induced PI3Kp110Î±, PI3KÎ±/Î´, PKCÎ², or GSK3 when ITGB1 gene was deleted, leading to alterations of TC cell cycle and proliferation. Of those PI3K isoform protein genes, mRNA expression of PIK3CG altered with ITGB1-negative TC cycle and proliferation. CONCLUSION: TCs have strong capacity of proliferation through the compensatory signaling mechanisms and contribute to the development of drug resistance due to alterations of TC sensitivity.',\n",

There are mainly two types of influenza virusesâ\\x80\\x94influenza A and B with several subtypesâ\\x80\\x94that are commonly found to circulate among humans. The traditional trivalent (TIV) flu vaccine targets two strains of influenza A and one strain of influenza B. The quadrivalent (QIV) vaccine targets one extra B virus strain that ensures better protection against influenza; however, the use of QIV vaccine can be costly, hence impose an extra financial burden to society. This scenario might create a dilemma in choosing vaccine types at the individual level. This article endeavours to explain such a dilemma through the framework of a vaccination game, where individuals can opt for one of the three options: choose either of QIV or TIV vaccine or none. Our approach presumes a mean-field framework of a vaccination game in an infinite and well-mixed population, entangling the disease spreading process of influenza with the coevolution of two types of vaccination decision-making processes taking place before an epidemic season. We conduct a series of numerical simulations as an attempt to illustrate different scenarios. The framework has been validated by the so-called multi-agent simulation (MAS) approach.',\n",
       " 'The dynamics of a spreadable disease are largely governed by four factors: proactive vaccination, retroactive treatment, individual decisions, and the prescribing behaviour of physicians. Under the imposed vaccination policy and antiviral treatment in society, complex factors (costs and expected effects of the vaccines and treatments, and fear of being infected) trigger an emulous situation in which individuals avoid infection by the pre-emptive or ex post provision. Aside from the established voluntary vaccination game, we propose a treatment game model associated with the resistance evolution of antiviral/antibiotic overuse. Moreover, the imperfectness of vaccinations has inevitably led to anti-vaccine behaviour, necessitating a proactive treatment policy. However, under the excessively heavy implementation of treatments such as antiviral medicine, resistant strains emerge. The model explicitly exhibits a dual social dilemma situation, in which the treatment behaviour changes on a local time scale, and the vaccination uptake later evolves on a global time scale. The impact of resistance evolution and the coexistence of dual dilemmas are investigated by the control reproduction number and the social efficiency deficit, respectively. Our investigation might elucidate the substantial impacts of both vaccination and treatment in the framework of epidemic dynamics, and hence suggest the appropriate use of antiviral treatment.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Influenza infections often remain undiagnosed in patients admitted to hospital due to lack of routine testing. When tested for, the diagnosis and treatment of influenza are often delayed due to the slow turnaround times of centralised laboratory PCR testing. Newer molecular systems, have comparable accuracy to laboratory PCR testing, and can generate a result in under 1 hour, making them potentially deployable as point-of-care tests (POCTs). High-quality evidence for the impact of routine POCT for influenza on clinical outcomes is, however, currently lacking. This large pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial aims to address this evidence gap. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The FluPOC trial is a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial evaluating adults admitted to a large teaching hospital and a district general hospital with an acute respiratory illness, during influenza season and defined by Public Health England. Up to 840 patients will be recruited over up to three influenza seasons, and randomised (1:1) to receive either POCT using the FilmArray respiratory panel, or routine clinical care. Clinical and infection control teams will be informed of the results in real time and where influenza is detected clinical teams will be encouraged to offer neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) treatment in accordance with national guidelines. Those allocated to standard clinical care will have a swab taken for later analysis to allow assessment of missed diagnoses. The outcomes assessment will be by retrospective case note analysis. The outcome measures include the proportion of influenza-positive patients detected and appropriately treated with NAIs, isolation facility use, antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, complications and mortality. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Prior to commencing the study, approval was obtained from the South Central Hampshire A Ethics Committee (reference 17/SC/0368, granted 7 September 2017). Results generated from this protocol will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at national and international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN17197293',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine has been reported to improve organ dysfunction in critically ill patients. In a recent randomized controlled trial (Dexmedetomidine for Sepsis in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Randomized Evolution [DESIRE]), we demonstrated that dexmedetomidine was associated with reduced mortality risk among patients with severe sepsis. We performed this exploratory sub-analysis to examine the mechanism underlying improved survival in patients sedated with dexmedetomidine. METHODS: The DESIRE trial compared a sedation strategy with and without dexmedetomidine among 201 mechanically ventilated adult patients with sepsis across eight ICUs in Japan. In the present study, we included 104 patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores of â\\x89¥ 23 (54 in the dexmedetomidine [DEX] group and 50 in the non-dexmedetomidine [non-DEX] group). Initially, we compared the changes in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores from the baseline within 6 days after randomization between groups. Subsequently, we evaluated the variables comprising the organ component of the SOFA score that showed relevant improvement in the initial comparison. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 71.0 Â± 14.1 years. There was no difference in the median APACHE II score between the two groups (29 [interquartile range (IQR), 25â\\x80\\x9331] vs. 30 [IQR, 25â\\x80\\x9333]; p = 0.35). The median SOFA score at the baseline was lower in the DEX group (9 [IQR, 7â\\x80\\x9311] vs. 11 [IQR, 9â\\x80\\x9313]; p = 0.01). While the renal SOFA subscore at the baseline was similar for both groups, it significantly decreased in the DEX group on day 4 (p = 0.02). During the first 6 days, the urinary output was not significantly different (p = 0.09), but serum creatinine levels were significantly lower (p = 0.04) in the DEX group. The 28-day and in-hospital mortality rates were significantly lower in the DEX group (22% vs. 42%; p = 0.03, 28% vs. 52%; p = 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: A sedation strategy with dexmedetomidine is associated with improved renal function and decrease mortality rates among patients with severe sepsis.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Global end-diastolic volume (GEDV) measured by transpulmonary thermodilution is regarded as indicator of cardiac preload. A bolus of cold saline injected in a central vein travels through the heart and lung, but also the aorta until detection in a femoral artery. While it is well accepted that injection in the inferior vena cava results in higher values, the impact of the aortic volume on GEDV is unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that a larger aortic volume directly translates to a numerically higher GEDV measurement. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 88 critically ill patients with thermodilution monitoring and who did require a contrast-enhanced thoraco-abdominal computed tomography scan. Aortic volumes derived from imaging were compared with GEDV measurements in temporal proximity. RESULTS: Median aortic volume was 194 ml (interquartile range 147 to 249 ml). Per milliliter increase of the aortic volume, we found a GEDV increase by 3.0 ml (95% CI 2.0 to 4.1 ml, p < 0.001). In case a femoral central venous line was used for saline bolus injection, GEDV raised additionally by 2.1 ml (95% CI 0.5 to 3.7 ml, p = 0.01) per ml volume of the vena cava inferior. Aortic volume explained 59.3% of the variance of thermodilution-derived GEDV. When aortic volume was included in multivariate regression, GEDV variance was unaffected by sex, age, body height, and weight. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the aortic volume is a substantial confounding variable for GEDV measurements performed with transpulmonary thermodilution. As the aorta is anatomically located after the heart, GEDV should not be considered to reflect cardiac preload. Guiding volume management by raw or indexed reference ranges of GEDV may be misleading.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is an important cause of acute respiratory illness in young children. Whole genome sequencing enables better identification of transmission events and outbreaks, which is not always possible with sub-genomic sequences. RESULTS: We report a 2-reaction amplicon-based next generation sequencing method to determine the complete genome sequences of five HMPV strains, representing three subgroups (A2, B1 and B2), directly from clinical samples. In addition to reporting five novel HMPV genomes from Africa we examined genetic diversity and sequence patterns of publicly available HMPV genomes. We found that the overall nucleotide sequence identity was 71.3 and 80% for HMPV group A and B, respectively, the diversity between HMPV groups was greater at amino acid level for SH and G surface protein genes, and multiple subgroups co-circulated in various countries. Comparison of sequences between HMPV groups revealed variability in G protein length (219 to 241 amino acids) due to changes in the stop codon position. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis showed congruence with the individual gene sequence sets except for F and M2 genes. CONCLUSION: This is the first genomic characterization of HMPV genomes from African patients.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) compromises the treatment of patients with serious infections in intensive care units (ICUs), and intensive care physicians are increasingly facing patients with bacterial infections with limited or no adequate therapeutic options. A survey was conducted to assess the intensive care physiciansâ\\x80\\x99 perception of the AMR situation in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA). METHODS: Between May and July 2017, physicians working in European ICUs were invited to complete an online questionnaire hosted by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. The survey included 20 questions on hospital and ICU characteristics, frequency of infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and relevance of AMR in the respondentâ\\x80\\x99s ICU, management of antimicrobial treatment as well as the use of last-line antibiotics in the six months preceding the survey. For the analysis of regional differences, EU/EEA countries were grouped into the four sub-regions of Eastern, Northern, Southern and Western Europe. RESULTS: Overall, 1062 responses from four European sub-regions were analysed. Infections with MDR bacteria in their ICU were rated as a major problem by 257 (24.2%), moderate problem by 360 (33.9%) and minor problem by 391 (36.8%) respondents. Third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were the most frequently encountered MDR bacteria followed by, in order of decreasing frequency, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Perception of the relevance of the AMR problem and the frequency of specific MDR bacteria varied by European sub-region. Bacteria resistant to all or almost all available antibiotics were encountered by 132 (12.4%) respondents. Many physicians reported not having access to specific last-line antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of European ICU physicians perceiving AMR as a substantial problem in their ICU is high with variation by sub-region in line with epidemiological studies. The reports of bacteria resistant to almost all available antibiotics and the limited availability of last-line antibiotics in ICUs in the EU/EEA are of concern.',\n",

Our primary aim was to review incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of AKI in burn patients admitted to the ICU. Secondary aims were to review the use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and impact on health care costs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, UpToDate, and NICE through 3 December 2018. All reviews in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews except protocols were added to the PubMed search. We searched for studies on AKI according to Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease (RIFLE); Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN); and/or Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria in burn patients admitted to the ICU. We collected data on AKI incidence, risk factors, use of RRT, renal recovery, length of stay (LOS), mortality, and health care costs. RESULTS: We included 33 observational studies comprising 8200 patients. Overall study quality, scored according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, was moderate. Random effect model meta-analysis revealed that the incidence of AKI among burn patients in the ICU was 38 (30â\\x80\\x9346) %. Patients with AKI were almost evenly distributed in the mild, moderate, and severe AKI subgroups. RRT was used in 12 (8â\\x80\\x9316) % of all patients. Risk factors for AKI were high age, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high Total Body Surface Area percent burnt, high Abbreviated Burn Severity Index score, inhalation injury, rhabdomyolysis, surgery, high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, sepsis, and mechanical ventilation. AKI patients had 8.6 (4.0â\\x80\\x9313.2) days longer ICU LOS and higher mortality than non-AKI patients, OR 11.3 (7.3â\\x80\\x9317.4). Few studies reported renal recovery, and no study reported health care costs. CONCLUSIONS: AKI occurred in 38% of burn patients admitted to the ICU, and 12% of all patients received RRT. Presence of AKI was associated with increased LOS and mortality. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (CRD42017060420)',\n",
       " 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is responsible for more deaths globally than any other pathogen. The only available vaccine, bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG), has variable efficacy throughout the world. A more effective vaccine is urgently needed. The immune response against tuberculosis relies, at least in part, on CD4(+) T cells. Protective vaccines require the induction of antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells via mycobacterial peptides presented by MHC class-II in infected macrophages. In order to identify mycobacterial antigens bound to MHC, we have immunoprecipitated MHC class-I and class-II complexes from THP-1 macrophages infected with BCG, purified MHC class-I and MHC class-II peptides and analysed them by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We have successfully identified 94 mycobacterial peptides presented by MHC-II and 43 presented by MHC-I, from 76 and 41 antigens, respectively. These antigens were found to be highly expressed in infected macrophages. Gene ontology analysis suggests most of these antigens are associated with membranes and involved in lipid biosynthesis and transport. The sequences of selected peptides were confirmed by spectral match validation and immunogenicity evaluated by IFN-gamma ELISpot against peripheral blood mononuclear cell from volunteers vaccinated with BCG, M.tb latently infected subjects or patients with tuberculosis disease. Three antigens were expressed in viral vectors, and evaluated as vaccine candidates alone or in combination in a murine aerosol M.tb challenge model. When delivered in combination, the three candidate vaccines conferred significant protection in the lungs and spleen compared with BCG alone, demonstrating proof-of-concept for this unbiased approach to identifying new candidate antigens.',\n",
       " 'A wide range of cancer immunotherapy approaches has been developed including non-specific immune-stimulants such as cytokines, cancer vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and adoptive T cell therapy. Among them, ICIs are the most commonly used and intensively studied. Since 2011, these drugs have received marketing authorisation for melanoma, lung, bladder, renal, and head and neck cancers, with remarkable and long-lasting treatment response in some patients. The novel mechanism of action of ICIs, with immune and T cell activation, leads to unusual patterns of response on imaging, with the advent of so-called pseudoprogression being more pronounced and frequently observed when compared to other anticancer therapies. Pseudoprogression, described in about 2â\\x80\\x9310% of patients treated with ICIs, corresponds to an increase of tumour burden and/or the appearance of new lesions due to infiltration by activated T cells before the disease responds to therapy. To overcome the limitation of response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) to assess these specific changes, new imaging criteriaâ\\x80\\x94so-called immune-related response criteria and then immune-related RECIST (irRECIST)â\\x80\\x94were proposed. The major modification involved the inclusion of the measurements of new target lesions into disease assessments and the need for a 4-week re-assessment to confirm or not confirm progression. The RECIST working group introduced the new concept of â\\x80\\x9cunconfirmed progressionâ\\x80\\x9d, into the irRECIST. This paper reviews current immunotherapeutic approaches and summarises radiologic criteria to evaluate new patterns of response to immunotherapy. Furthermore, imaging features of immunotherapy-related adverse events and available predictive biomarkers of response are presented.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: An efficient surface cleaning strategy would first target cleaning to surfaces that make large contributions to the risk of infections. METHODS: In this study, we used data from the literature about methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and developed an ordinary differential equations based mathematical model to quantify the impact of contact heterogeneity on MRSA transmission in a hypothetical 6-bed intensive care unit (ICU). The susceptible patients are divided into two types, these who are cared by the same nurse as the MRSA infected patient (Type 1) and these who are not (Type 2). RESULTS: The results showed that the mean MRSA concentration on three kinds of susceptible patient nearby surfaces was significantly linearly associated with the hand-touch frequency (p < 0.05). The noncompliance of daily cleaning on patient nearby high-touch surfaces (HTSs) had the most impact on MRSA transmission. If the HTSs were not cleaned, the MRSA exposure to Type 1 and 2 susceptible patients would increase 118.4% (standard deviation (SD): 33.0%) and 115.4% (SD: 30.5%) respectively. The communal surfaces (CSs) had the least impact, if CSs were not cleaned, the MRSA exposure to Type 1 susceptible patient would only increase 1.7% (SD: 1.3). The impact of clinical equipment (CE) differed largely for two types of susceptible patients. If the CE was not cleaned, the exposure to Type 1 patients would only increase 8.4% (SD: 3.0%), while for Type 2 patients, it can increase 70.4% (SD: 25.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a framework to study the pathogen concentration dynamics on environmental surfaces and quantitatively showed the importance of cleaning patient nearby HTSs on controlling the nosocomial infection transmission via contact route.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: General self-efficacy is considered one of the most influential parameters affecting the quality of clinical practice and nursesâ\\x80\\x99 perceived professional benefits (NPPB). Perceived organizational support (POS) is regarded as being central in understanding job-related attitudes, and it is important to enhance POS for nurses to maintain their current employment. NPPB can further reduce nursesâ\\x80\\x99 job burnout and turn-over intention. Many studies have explored the relationships among general self-efficacy, POS, nursing practice environment (NPE) and NPPB. However, a moderating effect of NPE has not been fully explored in nurses, especially among paediatric nurses. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from July to October 2018 with 300 paediatric nurses from 3 Class A tertiary hospitals in Jilin Province. The respondents completed the General Self-Efficacy Scale, Perceived Organizational Support Scale, Practice Environment Scale and Nursesâ\\x80\\x99 Perceived Professional Benefits Scale. The data were analyzed using path analysis and SPSS (version 23.0, IBM). RESULTS: General self-efficacy and POS were significantly positively associated with NPPB, which showed that the model had a good fit to the data. NPE was found to play a partial mediating role between POS and NPPB and also had a complete mediating role between general self-efficacy and NPPB. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that general self-efficacy indirectly influences NPPB, and POS directly and indirectly influences NPPB by NPE. Effective measures should be taken to improve nursesâ\\x80\\x99 practice environment in hospitals to raise nursesâ\\x80\\x99 enthusiasm and confidence in their work.',\n",

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on patients with pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital in Taiwan between January 2014 and December 2016. To analyze the clinical characteristics of these patients, data was extracted from their medical records. K. pneumoniae strains were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, capsular genotyping and detection of the rmpA and rmpA2 genes to identify hypervirulent strains. RESULTS: We identified 276 patients with pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae, of which 68 (24.6%), 74 (26.8%), and 134 (48.6%) presented with CAP, HCAP, and HAP, respectively. The 28-day mortality was highest in the HAP group (39.6%), followed by the HCAP (29.7%) and CAP (27.9%) groups. The HAP group also featured the highest proportion of multi-drug resistant strains (49.3%), followed by the HCAP (36.5%) and CAP groups (10.3%), while the CAP group had the highest proportion of hypervirulent strains (79.4%), followed by the HCAP (55.4%) and HAP groups (41.0%). CONCLUSION: Pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae was associated with a high mortality. Importantly, multi-drug resistant strains were also detected in patients with CAP. Hypervirulent strains were prevalent in all 3 groups of pneumonia patients, even in those with HAP.',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) healthcare-associated infections (HAI) in Egyptian hospitals reporting to the national HAI surveillance system. METHODS: Design: Descriptive analysis of CRE HAIs and retrospective observational cohort study using national HAI surveillance data. Setting: Egyptian hospitals participating in the HAI surveillance system. The patient population included patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in participating hospitals. Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases were Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter isolates from blood, urine, wound or respiratory specimen collected on or after day 3 of ICU admission. CRE HAI cases were those resistant to at least one carbapenem. For CRE HAI cases reported during 2011â\\x80\\x932017, a hospital-level and patient-level analysis were conducted using only the first CRE isolate by pathogen and specimen type for each patient. For facility, microbiology, and clinical characteristics, frequencies and means were calculated among CRE HAI cases and compared with carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases through univariate and multivariate logistic regression using STATA 13. RESULTS: There were 1598 Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases, of which 871 (54.1%) were carbapenem resistant. The multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that carbapenem resistance was associated with specimen type, pathogen, location prior to admission, and length of ICU stay. Between 2011 and 2017, there was an increase in the proportion of Enterobacteriaceae HAI cases due to CRE (p-value = 0.003) and the incidence of CRE HAIs (p-value = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrated a high and increasing burden of CRE in Egyptian hospitals, highlighting the importance of enhancing infection prevention and control (IPC) programs and antimicrobial stewardship activities and guiding the implementation of targeted IPC measures to contain CRE in Egyptian ICUâ\\x80\\x99s .',\n",
       " 'Mammalian asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) is a cysteine protease that cleaves its protein substrates on the C-terminal side of asparagine residues. Converging lines of evidence indicate that AEP may be involved in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases, including Alzheimerâ\\x80\\x99s disease, Parkinsonâ\\x80\\x99s disease, and frontotemporal dementia. AEP is activated in the aging brain, cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) and promotes the production of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²). We renamed AEP to Î´-secretase to emphasize its role in APP fragmentation and AÎ² production. AEP also cleaves other substrates, such as tau, Î±-synuclein, SET, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43, generating neurotoxic fragments and disturbing their physiological functions. The activity of Î´-secretase is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. Here, we review the recent advances in the role of Î´-secretase in neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on its biochemical properties and the transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of its activity, and discuss the clinical implications of Î´-secretase as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Influenza A viruses cause epidemics/severe pandemics that pose a great global health threat. Among eight viral RNA segments, the multiple functions of nucleoprotein (NP) play important roles in viral replication and transcription. METHODS: To understand how NP contributes to the virus evolution, we analyzed the NP gene of H3N2 viruses in Taiwan and 14,220 NP sequences collected from Influenza Research Database. The identified genetic variations were further analyzed by mini-genome assay, virus growth assay, viral RNA and protein expression as well as ferret model to analyze their impacts on viral replication properties. RESULTS: The NP genetic analysis by Taiwan and global sequences showed similar evolution pattern that the NP backbones changed through time accompanied with specific residue substitutions from 1999 to 2018. Other than the conserved residues, fifteen sporadic substitutions were observed in which the 31R, 377G and 450S showed higher frequency. We found 31R and 450S decreased polymerase activity while the dominant residues (31 K and 450G) had higher activity. The 31 K and 450G showed better viral translation and replication in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated variations identified in evolution have roles in modulating viral replication in vitro and in vivo. This study demonstrates that the interaction between variations of NP during virus evolution deserves future attention.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) has been recognized as a global pandemic with a high rate of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. Although numerous advances have been made, its representative molecular signatures remain largely unknown, especially the role of genes in HF progression. The aim of the present prospective follow-up study was to reveal potential biomarkers associated with the progression of heart failure. METHODS: We generated multi-level transcriptomic data from a cohort of left ventricular heart tissue collected from 21 HF patients and 9 healthy donors. By using Masson staining to calculate the fibrosis percentage for each sample, we applied lasso regression model to identify the genes associated with fibrosis as well as progression. The genes were further validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in the same cohort and qRT-PCR using another independent cohort (20 HF and 9 healthy donors). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the plasma level in a validation cohort (139 HF patients) for predicting HF progression. RESULTS: Based on the multi-level transcriptomic data, we examined differentially expressed genes [mRNAs, microRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)] in the study cohort. The follow-up functional annotation and regulatory network analyses revealed their potential roles in regulating extracellular matrix. We further identified several genes that were associated with fibrosis. By using the survival time before transplantation, COL1A1 was identified as a potential biomarker for HF progression and its upregulation was confirmed by both IHC and qRT-PCR. Furthermore, COL1A1 content â\\x89¥ 256.5 ng/ml in plasma was found to be associated with poor survival within 1 year of heart transplantation from heart failure [hazard ratio (HR) 7.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5 to 15.8, Log-rank p value < 1.0 Ã\\x97 10(â\\x88\\x92 4)]. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that COL1A1 might be a plasma biomarker of HF and associated with HF progression, especially to predict the 1-year survival from HF onset to transplantation.',\n",
       " 'Modern societies are exposed to a myriad of risks ranging from disease to natural hazards and technological disruptions. Exploring how the awareness of risk spreads and how it triggers a diffusion of coping strategies is prominent in the research agenda of various domains. It requires a deep understanding of how individuals perceive risks and communicate about the effectiveness of protective measures, highlighting learning and social interaction as the core mechanisms driving such processes. Methodological approaches that range from purely physics-based diffusion models to data-driven environmental methods rely on agent-based modeling to accommodate context-dependent learning and social interactions in a diffusion process. Mixing agent-based modeling with data-driven machine learning has become popularity. However, little attention has been paid to the role of intelligent learning in risk appraisal and protective decisions, whether used in an individual or a collective process. The differences between collective learning and individual learning have not been sufficiently explored in diffusion modeling in general and in agent-based models of socio-environmental systems in particular. To address this research gap, we explored the implications of intelligent learning on the gradient from individual to collective learning, using an agent-based model enhanced by machine learning. Our simulation experiments showed that individual intelligent judgement about risks and the selection of coping strategies by groups with majority votes were outperformed by leader-based groups and even individuals deciding alone. Social interactions appeared essential for both individual learning and group learning. The choice of how to represent social learning in an agent-based model could be driven by existing cultural and social norms prevalent in a modeled society.',\n",
       " 'Mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains unacceptably high at approximately 39%. One of the only treatments is supportive: mechanical ventilation. However, improperly set mechanical ventilation can further increase the risk of death in patients with ARDS. Recent studies suggest that ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) is caused by exaggerated regional lung strain, particularly in areas of alveolar instability subject to tidal recruitment/derecruitment and stress-multiplication. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that if a ventilation strategy can maintain stable lung inflation and homogeneity, regional dynamic strain would be reduced and VILI attenuated. A time-controlled adaptive ventilation (TCAV) method was developed to minimize dynamic alveolar strain by adjusting the delivered breath according to the mechanical characteristics of the lung. The goal of this review is to describe how the TCAV method impacts pathophysiology and protects lungs with, or at high risk of, acute lung injury. We present work from our group and others that identifies novel mechanisms of VILI in the alveolar microenvironment and demonstrates that the TCAV method can reduce VILI in translational animal ARDS models and mortality in surgical/trauma patients. Our TCAV method utilizes the airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode and is based on opening and collapsing time constants, which reflect the viscoelastic properties of the terminal airspaces. Time-controlled adaptive ventilation uses inspiratory and expiratory time to (1) gradually â\\x80\\x9cnudgeâ\\x80\\x9d alveoli and alveolar ducts open with an extended inspiratory duration and (2) prevent alveolar collapse using a brief (sub-second) expiratory duration that does not allow time for alveolar collapse. The new paradigm in TCAV is configuring each breath guided by the previous one, which achieves real-time titration of ventilator settings and minimizes instability induced tissue damage. This novel methodology changes the current approach to mechanical ventilation, from arbitrary to personalized and adaptive. The outcome of this approach is an open and stable lung with reduced regional strain and greater lung protection.',\n",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of prior receipt of antibiotics on the microorganism distribution. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted in a 3200-bed tertiary, referral, teaching hospital in eastern China. During a 2-year period, all hospitalized patients treated with antimicrobial agents were enrolled in this study. Among 48,692 patients evaluated, the 27,792 (57.1%) who were sampled within 2 days before or after administration of the first dose of antimicrobial agents were included. Distribution of clinical specimens and the microorganism were compared between before and after antibiotic drug treatment groups. RESULTS: Compared to specimens taken after antibiotics exposure, specimens taken before antibiotics exposure had a higher proportion of blood and urine specimens and a higher culture positive rate (all P < 0.001). Higher percentages of Staphylococcus aureus (9.9% vs. 8.5%, P = 0.041), non-fermenting bacteria (27.7% vs. 19.9%, P < 0.001), and fungi (8.4% vs. 4.0%, P < 0.001) were isolated from the group after antibiotics exposure, while the percentages of Streptococcus spp. (4.8% vs. 2.7%, P < 0.001), Haemophilus influenzae (2.3% vs. 0.8%, P < 0.001), and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.7% vs. 0.1%, P < 0.001) were higher in the group before antibiotics exposure. Further analysis found significant differences of microbes derived from respiratory secretions, blood or urine samples. We found, after antibiotics exposure, the separation rate of non-fermenting bacteria was significantly increased (all P < 0.05), and the separation rate of Candida spp. was higher, with statistical significance in airway secretion and urine samples (both P < 0.05), but the separation rate of Staphylococcus aureus among the three groups was not affected by antibiotics. In addition, the isolation rate of Streptococcus spp. in blood and urine samples decreased significantly (both P < 0.05) after antibiotics exposure. Interestingly, no statistical difference was found for microbes isolated from body fluid specimens between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome revealed that antibiotic-insensitive organisms such as non-fermentative bacteria and fungi were more frequently isolated after antibiotics exposure. However, this trend might be specimen dependent and was not obvious in body fluid specimens.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: In pediatric cardiac anesthesiology, there is increased focus on minimizing morbidity, ensuring optimal functional status, and using health care resources sparingly. One aspect of care that has potential to affect all of the above is postoperative mechanical ventilation. Historically, postoperative ventilation was considered a must for maintaining patient stability. Ironically, it is recognized that mechanical ventilation may increase risk of adverse outcomes in the postoperative period. Hence, many institutions have advocated for immediate extubation or early extubation after many congenital heart surgeries which was first reported decades ago. METHODS: 637 consecutive patient charts were reviewed for pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were placed into three groups. Those that were extubated in the operating room (OR) at the conclusion of surgery (Immediate Extubation or IE), those that were extubated within six hours of admission to the ICU (Early Extubation or EE) and those that were extubated sometime after six hours (Delayed Extubation or DE). Multiple variables were then recorded to see which factors correlated with successful Immediate or Early Extubation. RESULTS: Overall, 338 patients (53.1%) had IE), 273 (42.8%) had DE while only 26 patients (4.1%) had EE. The median age was 1174 days for the IE patients, 39 days for the DE patients, whereas 194 days for EE patients (p < 0.001). Weight and length were also significantly different in at least one extubation group from the other two (p < 0.001). The median ICU LOS was 3 and 4 days for IE and EE patients respectively, whereas it was 9.5 days for DE patients (p < 0.001). DE group had a significant longer median anesthesia time and cardiopulmonary bypass time than the other two extubation groups (p > 63,826.88 < 0.001). Regional low flow perfusion, deep hypothermia, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, redo sternotomy, use of other sedatives, furosemide, epinephrine, vasopressin, open chest, cardiopulmonary support, pulmonary edema, syndrome, as well as difficult intubation were significantly associated with delayed extubation (IE, EE or DE). CONCLUSIONS: Immediate and early extubation was significantly associated with several factors, including patient age and size, duration of CPB, use of certain anesthetic drugs, and the amount of blood loss and blood replacement. IE can be successfully accomplished in a majority of pediatric patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease, including in a minority of infants.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Vaccines are the most reliable alternative to elicit sterile immunity against malaria but their development has been hindered by polymorphisms and strain-specificity in previously studied antigens. New vaccine candidates are therefore urgently needed. Highly conserved Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homologue-5 (PfRH5) has been identified as a potential candidate for anti-disease vaccine development. PfRH5 is essential for erythrocyte invasion by merozoites and crucial for parasite survival. However, there is paucity of data on the extent of genetic variations on PfRH5 in field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum. This study described genetic polymorphisms at the high affinity binding polypeptides (HABPs) 36718, 36727, 36728 of PfRH5 in Nigerian isolates of P. falciparum. This study tested the hypothesis that only specific conserved B and T cell epitopes on PfRH5 HABPs are crucial for vaccine development. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-five microscopically confirmed P. falciparum samples collected in a prospective cross-sectional study of three different populations in Lagos, Nigeria. Genetic diversity and haplotype construct of Pfrh5 gene were determined using bi-directional sequencing approach. Tajimaâ\\x80\\x99s D and the ratio of nonsynonymous vs synonymous mutations were utilized to estimate the extent of balancing and directional selection in the pfrh5 gene. RESULTS: Sequence analysis revealed three haplotypes of PfRH5 with negative Tajimaâ\\x80\\x99s D and dN/dS value of â\\x88\\x92 1.717 and 0.011 Â± 0.020, respectively. A single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP (G â\\x86\\x92 A) at position 608 was observed, which resulted in a change of the amino acid cysteine at position 203 to tyrosine. Haplotype and nucleotide diversities were 0.318 Â± 0.016 and 0.0046 Â± 0.0001 while inter-population genetic differentiation ranged from 0.007 to 0.037. Five polypeptide variants were identified, the most frequent being KTKYH with a frequency of 51.3%. One B-cell epitope, 151 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II T-cell epitopes, four intrinsically unstructured regions (IURs) and six MHC class I T-cell epitopes were observed in the study. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences showed clustering and evidence of evolutionary relationship with 3D7, PAS-2 and FCB-2 RH5 sequences. CONCLUSIONS: This study has revealed low level of genetic polymorphisms in PfRH5 antigen with B- and T-cell epitopes in intrinsically unstructured regions along the PfRH5 gene in Lagos, Nigeria. A broader investigation is however required in other parts of the country to support the possible inclusion of PfRH5 in a cross-protective multi-component vaccine.',\n",
       " 'The brainstem conveys sensory and motor inputs between the spinal cord and the brain, and contains nuclei of the cranial nerves. It controls the sleep-wake cycle and vital functions via the ascending reticular activating system and the autonomic nuclei, respectively. Brainstem dysfunction may lead to sensory and motor deficits, cranial nerve palsies, impairment of consciousness, dysautonomia, and respiratory failure. The brainstem is prone to various primary and secondary insults, resulting in acute or chronic dysfunction. Of particular importance for characterizing brainstem dysfunction and identifying the underlying etiology are a detailed clinical examination, MRI, neurophysiologic tests such as brainstem auditory evoked potentials, and an analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid. Detection of brainstem dysfunction is challenging but of utmost importance in comatose and deeply sedated patients both to guide therapy and to support outcome prediction. In the present review, we summarize the neuroanatomy, clinical syndromes, and diagnostic techniques of critical illness-associated brainstem dysfunction for the critical care setting.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Growth hormone inducible transmembrane protein (GHITM) is a highly conserved transmembrane protein. This study was conducted to investigate the role of GHITM gene in the apoptosis and growth of the golden apple snail Pomacea canaliculate. RESULTS: The complete cDNA of this gene was cloned using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method and subjected to bioinformatics analysis. The full-length cDNA was 2242 bp, including an open reading frame of 1021 bp that encoded a protein of 342 amino acid residues. The mRNA expression profiles of GHITM gene in different tissues (liver, kidney, gonad and foot) and different growth phases (6-months old and 2-years old) showed that it was expressed in various tissues and different growth phases. Silencing of the GHITM gene by RNAi (RNA interference) experiments revealed that the GHITM gene possibly plays a role in inhibiting apoptosis through detecting the Caspase (Cysteine-requiring Aspartate Protease)-3 activity. In addition, the aperture width and body whorl length of the snail was significantly affected by RNAi, suggesting that this gene plays a significant role in promoting the growth of the organism. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that the GHITM gene was involved in apoptosis and growth in golden apple snail.',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which acute care hospitals in the Netherlands have adopted recommended practices to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). METHODS: Between 18 July 2017 and 31 October 2017, we surveyed the infection prevention teams of all acute care hospitals in the Netherlands. The survey instrument was based on the â\\x80\\x98Translating Healthcare-Associated Infection Prevention Research into Practiceâ\\x80\\x99 (TRIP) questionnaire and adapted to the Dutch context. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the reported regular use of CAUTI, CLABSI, VAP, and CDI prevention practices as well as the hospital characteristics. RESULTS: Out of 72 eligible hospitals, 47 (65.3%) responded. Surveillance systems for monitoring CAUTI, CLABSI, VAP, and CDI were present in 17.8, 95.4, 26.2, and 77.3% of hospitals, respectively. Antimicrobial stewardship programs have been established in 91.5% of participating hospitals. For CAUTI, the majority of hospitals regularly used aseptic technique during catheter insertion (95%) and portable bladder ultrasound scanners (86.1%). Intermittent catheterization and catheter stop-orders were regularly used by 65.8 and 62.2% of hospitals. For CLABSI, all hospitals regularly used maximum sterile barrier precautions and chlorhexidine gluconate for insertion site antisepsis. Avoidance of the femoral site for central line insertions was regularly used by 65.9% of hospitals. Urinary catheters and central-lines impregnated with antibiotics or antiseptics were rarely used (â\\x89¤ 5%). Selective decontamination strategies for preventing VAP were used in 84% of hospitals. With the exception of disposable thermometers (31.8%), all prevention practices to prevent CDI were regularly used by more than 80% of hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Most Dutch hospitals report regular use of recommended practices for preventing CLABSI and CDI. Several specific practices to prevent CAUTI and VAP were less frequently used, however, providing an opportunity for improvement.',\n",
       " 'The study described poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) accumulation in Bacillus aryabhattai PHB10 for the first time and evaluated the polymer induced cytotoxicity in-vitro with PHBV/poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) blends. The B. aryabhattai strain produced 2.8 g/L PHBV, equivalent to 71.15% of cell dry mass in a medium supplemented with propionic acid, after 48 h incubation. The optimum temperature and pH for the copolymer accumulation was 31 Â°C and 7, respectively. The gas chromatographyâ\\x80\\x93mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses confirmed the polymer obtained as PHBV. The differential scanning calorimetry analysis revealed that the melting point of the material as 90 Â°C and its thermal stability up to 220 Â°C. The average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index of the sample was estimated by gel permeation chromatography analysis and observed as 128.508 kDa and 2.82, respectively. The PHBV showed tensile strength of 10.3 MPa and elongation at break of 13.3%. The PHBV and their blends with PEG were tested for cytotoxicity on human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) and the cells incubated with PHBV/PEG2kDa blends were 99% viable, whereas with the PHBV alone showed comparatively higher cytotoxicity. The significant improvement in the cell viability of PHBV/PEG2kDa blends indicates its potential as a candidate for skin graft applications.',\n",
       " 'PCV3 capsid protein (Cap) is an important antigen for diagnosis and vaccine development. To achieve high-level expression of recombinant PCV3 Cap in Escherichia coli (E. coli), the gene of wild-type entire Cap (wt-eCap) was amplified from clinical samples, and three optimized entire Cap (opti-eCap) and one optimized Cap deleted nuclear location signal (NLS) (opti-dCap) gene fragments encoding the same amino acid sequence with wt-eCap were synthesized based on the codon bias of E. coli. Those gene fragments were inserted into the pET30a expression vector. One recombinant strain with the highest expressed soluble eCap from four entire Cap (one wt-eCap and three opti-eCap) and one recombinant strain expressed opti-dCap were selected for further purification. The purified eCap and dCap were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a large number of round hollow particles with a diameter of 10 nm virus-like particles (VLPs) were observed in eCap, whereas irregular aggregation of proteins observed in dCap. After formation the VLPs were applied as a coating antigen to establish an indirect ELISA (I-ELISA) for detection of PCV3-specific antibody in swine serum. 373 clinical swine serum samples from China collected in 2019 were tested utilizing the VLP-based I-ELISA method under optimized conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of self-assembly into VLPs of PCV3 recombinant Cap. Our results demonstrated that the VLP-based I-ELISA will be a valuable tool for detecting the presence of PCV3 antibodies in serum samples and will facilitate screening of large numbers of swine serum for clinical purposes.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) provide the most reliable information to inform clinical practice and patient care. We aimed to map global clinical research publication activity through RCT-related articles in high-impact-factor medical journals over the past five decades. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of articles published in the highest ranked medical journals with an impact factor > 10 (according to Journal Citation Reports published in 2017). We searched PubMed/MEDLINE (from inception to December 31, 2017) for all RCT-related articles (e.g. primary RCTs, secondary analyses and methodology papers) published in high-impact-factor medical journals. For each included article, raw metadata were abstracted from the Web of Science. A process of standardization was conducted to unify the different terms and grammatical variants and to remove typographical, transcription and/or indexing errors. Descriptive analyses were conducted (including the number of articles, citations, most prolific authors, countries, journals, funding sources and keywords). Network analyses of collaborations between countries and co-words are presented. RESULTS: We included 39,305 articles (for the period 1965â\\x80\\x932017) published in forty journals. The Lancet (n = 3593; 9.1%), the Journal of Clinical Oncology (n = 3343; 8.5%) and The New England Journal of Medicine (n = 3275 articles; 8.3%) published the largest number of RCTs. A total of 154 countries were involved in the production of articles. The global productivity ranking was led by the United States (n = 18,393 articles), followed by the United Kingdom (n = 8028 articles), Canada (n = 4548 articles) and Germany (n = 4415 articles). Seventeen authors who had published 100 or more articles were identified; the most prolific authors were affiliated with Duke University (United States), Harvard University (United States) and McMaster University (Canada). The main funding institutions were the National Institutes of Health (United States), Hoffmann-La Roche (Switzerland), Pfizer (United States), Merck Sharp & Dohme (United States) and Novartis (Switzerland). The 100 most cited RCTs were published in nine journals, led by The New England Journal of Medicine (n = 78 articles), The Lancet (n = 9 articles) and JAMA (n = 7 articles). These landmark contributions focused on novel methodological approaches (e.g. the â\\x80\\x9cBland-Altman methodâ\\x80\\x9d) and trials on the management of chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes control, hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, multiple therapies for diverse cancers, cardiovascular therapies such as lipid-lowering statins, antihypertensive medications, and antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis identified authors, countries, funding institutions, landmark contributions and high-impact-factor medical journals publishing RCTs. Over the last 50 years, publication production in leading medical journals has increased, with Western countries leading in research but with low- and middle-income countries showing very limited representation.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Professional caregivers working in child and youth welfare institutions are frequently faced with the complex mental health issues, emotional needs and challenging coping strategies of clients with cumulated traumatic experiences, leaving them prone to developing high levels of stress, burn-out and compassion fatigue. Trauma-informed care (TIC) is a milieu-therapeutic approach that aims to promote the self-efficacy and self-care of youth welfare staff by guiding them to a better understanding of their own and their clientsâ\\x80\\x99 stress symptoms and countertransference. Despite increasing efforts to implement TIC practices, and more widespread recognition of their value in youth welfare systems, there is a lack of studies evaluating the effectiveness of this approach. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of TIC practices in youth welfare institutions on both the physiological stress of staff members and clientsâ\\x80\\x99 physical aggression towards their caregivers. . METHODS: Data was obtained from a longitudinal study investigating the effectiveness of TIC in 14 residential youth welfare institutions. Our sample consisted of 47 youth welfare employees (66.0% female) aged from 23 to 60 years (M = 37.4, SD = 10.4 years). Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) and occurrences of client physical aggression were assessed at four annual measurement time points (T1 to T4). RESULTS: Participants in five institutions employing TIC practices (intervention group) showed significantly lower HCC at T4 than staff members from institutions who did not receive training in TIC (control group), indicating reduced physiological stress levels. At T4, the intervention group reported significantly less physical aggression than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: TIC might be a promising approach for reducing the emotional burden of employees and institutions should invest in training their staff in TIC practices. More research is necessary, to investigate the benefits and efficacy of TIC, both to youths and staff members, and to foster a better understanding of which specific factors may contribute to stress reduction.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CR-BSI) cause high neonatal mortality and are related to inadequate aseptic technique during the care and maintenance of a catheter. The incidence of CR-BSI among neonates in Hung Vuong Hospital was higher than that of other neonatal care centres in Vietnam. METHODS: An 18-month pre- and post-intervention study was conducted over three 6-month periods to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention for CR-BSI and to identify risk factors associated with CR-BSI. During the intervention period, we trained all nurses in the Department of Neonatology on BSI preventive practices, provided auditing and feedback about aseptic technique during catheter care and maintenance, and reorganised preparation of total parenteral nutrition. All neonates with intravenous catheter insertion â\\x89¥48 h in the pre- and post-intervention period were enrolled. A standardised questionnaire was used to collect data. Blood samples were collected for cultures. We used Poisson regression to calculate rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for CR-BSI incidence rates and logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with CR-BSI. RESULTS: Of 2225 neonates enrolled, 1027 were enrolled in the pre-intervention period, of which 53 CR-BSI cases occurred in 8399 catheter-days, and 1198 were enrolled in the post-intervention period, of which 32 CR-BSI cases occurred in 8324 catheter-days. Incidence rates of CR-BSI significantly decreased after the intervention (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.39â\\x80\\x930.94). Days of hospitalisation, episodes of non-catheterâ\\x80\\x93related hospital-acquired infections, and the proportion of deaths significantly decreased after the intervention (p < 0.01). The CR-BSI was associated with days of intravenous catheter (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03â\\x80\\x931.08), use of endotracheal intubation (OR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.27â\\x80\\x934.06), and intravenous injection (OR = 8.50, 95% CI 1.14â\\x80\\x9363.4). CONCLUSIONS: The interventions significantly decreased the incidence rate of CR-BSI. Regular refresher training and auditing and feedback about aseptic technique during care and maintenance of catheters are critical to reducing CR-BSI.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a frequent complication in patients undergoing heart transplantation (HTx) that increases morbidity and mortality in this population. Nevertheless, the risk factors for postoperative pneumonia (POP) are still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive risk factors for POP in HTx recipients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, all patients undergoing HTx between January 2014 and December 2015 were included. All cases of POP occurring until hospital discharge were investigated. The study aimed to determine risk factors using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models. Data are expressed in Odds Ratio [95% CI]. P < 0.05 was necessary to reject the null hypothesis. RESULTS: A total of 175 patients were included without any patients being lost to follow-up, and 89 instances of POP were diagnosed in 59 (34%) patients. Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common pathogens. In the multivariate analysis, the risk factors were preoperative mechanical ventilation (OR 1.42 [1.12â\\x80\\x931.80], P < 0.01) and perioperative blood transfusion (OR 1.42 [95% CI: 1.20â\\x80\\x931.70], P < 0.01). POP significantly impacted mortality at 30 days (OR: 4 [1.3â\\x80\\x9312.4], P = 0.01) and 1 year (OR: 6.8 [2.5â\\x80\\x938.4], P < 0.01) and was associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, time to weaning from venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and stay in an intensive care unit. Plasma exchanges and intravenous administration of immunoglobulins did not increase the risk of POP. CONCLUSION: After HTx, preoperative mechanical ventilation and blood transfusion were risk factors for POP and were associated with increased mortality. Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common pathogens of POP.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Immunization with attenuated malaria sporozoites protects humans from experimental malaria challenge by mosquito bite. Protection in humans is strongly correlated with the production of T cells targeting a heterogeneous population of pre-erythrocyte antigen proteoforms, including liver stage antigens. Currently, few T cell epitopes derived from Plasmodium falciparum, the major aetiologic agent of malaria in humans are known. METHODS: In this study both in vitro and in vivo malaria liver stage models were used to sequence host and pathogen proteoforms. Proteoforms from these diverse models were subjected to mild acid elution (of soluble forms), multi-dimensional fractionation, tandem mass spectrometry, and top-down bioinformatics analysis to identify proteoforms in their intact state. RESULTS: These results identify a group of host and malaria liver stage proteoforms that meet a 5% false discovery rate threshold. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides proof-of-concept for the validity of this mass spectrometry/bioinformatic approach for future studies seeking to reveal malaria liver stage antigens towards vaccine development.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Toxocariasis is a worldwide zoonotic parasitic disease caused by species of Toxocara and Toxascaris, common in dogs and cats. Herein, a meta-analysis was contrived to assess the prevalence of Toxocara/Toxascaris in carnivore and human hosts in different regions of Iran from April 1969 to June 2019. METHODS: The available online articles of English (PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Ovid) and Persian (SID, Iran Medex, Magiran, and Iran Doc) databases and also the articles that presented in held parasitology congresses of Iran were involved. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of Toxocara/Toxascaris in dogs (Canis familiaris) and cats (Felis catus) was 24.2% (95% CI: 18.0â\\x80\\x9331.0%) and 32.6% (95% CI: 22.6â\\x80\\x9343.4%), respectively. Also, pooled prevalence in jackal (Canis aureus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) was 23.3% (95% CI: 7.7â\\x80\\x9343.2%) and 69.4% (95% CI: 60.3â\\x80\\x9377.8%), correspondingly. Weighted mean prevalence of human cases with overall 28 records was 9.3% (95% CI: 6.3â\\x80\\x9313.1%). The weighted prevalence of Toxocara canis, Toxocara cati, and Toxascaris leonina was represented as 13.8% (95% CI: 9.8â\\x80\\x9318.3%), 28.5% (95% CI: 20â\\x80\\x9337.7%) and 14.3% (95% CI: 8.1â\\x80\\x9322.0%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis results illustrate a considerable prevalence rate of Toxocara/Toxascaris, particularly in cats and dogs of northern parts of Iran. The presence of suitable animal hosts, optimum climate and close contact of humans and animals would have been the reason for higher seroprevalence rates of human cases in our region. Given the significance clinical outcomes of human Toxocara/Toxascaris, necessary measures should be taken.',\n",
       " \"Despite the availability of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, sustained viral response (SVR) rates remain suboptimal for difficult-to-treat patient populations such as those with HCV genotype 3, cirrhosis or prior treatment experience, warranting development of more potent HCV replication antivirals. AT-527 is the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511, a novel phosphoramidate prodrug of 2â\\x80\\x99-fluoro-2â\\x80\\x99-C-methylguanosine-5'-monophosphate that has potent in vitro activity against HCV. The EC(50) of AT-511, determined using HCV laboratory strains and clinical isolates with genotypes 1â\\x80\\x935, ranged from 5â\\x80\\x9328 nM. The active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, specifically inhibited the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. AT-511 did not inhibit the replication of other selected RNA or DNA viruses in vitro. AT-511 was approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF) against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV genotypes 1â\\x80\\x935 and remained fully active against S282T resistance-associated variants, with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. In vitro, AT-511 did not inhibit human DNA polymerases or elicit cytotoxicity or mitochondrial toxicity at concentrations up to 100 Î¼M. Unlike the other potent guanosine analogs PSI-938 and PSI-661, no mutagenic O(6)-alkylguanine bases were formed when incubated with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and AT-511 had IC(50) values â\\x89¥25 Î¼M against a panel of CYP enzymes. In hepatocytes from multiple species, the active triphosphate was the predominant metabolite produced from the prodrug, with a half-life of 10 h in human hepatocytes. When given orally to rats and monkeys, AT-527 preferentially delivered high levels of AT-9010 in the liver in vivo. These favorable preclinical attributes support the ongoing clinical development of AT-527 and suggest that, when used in combination with an HCV DAA from a different class, AT-527 may increase SVR rates, especially for difficult-to-treat patient populations, and could potentially shorten treatment duration for all patients.\",\n",
       " 'This retrospective cohort study investigated the association between in-hospital survival and two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography within 24 hours after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in patients who underwent in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ICPR) after in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest (IHCA). The 2D-echo and non-2D-echo groups comprised eligible patients who underwent transthoracic 2D echocardiography performed by the cardiology team within 24 hours after ROSC and those who did not, respectively. After propensity score (PS) matching, 142 and 284 patients in the 2D-echo and non-2D-echo groups, respectively, were included. A logistic regression analysis showed that the likelihood of in-hospital survival was 2.35-fold higher in the 2D-echo group than in the non-2D-echo group (P < 0.001). Regarding IHCA aetiology, in-hospital survival after cardiac arrest of a cardiac cause was 2.51-fold more likely in the 2D-echo group than in the non-2D-echo group (P < 0.001), with no significant inter-group difference in survival after cardiac arrest of a non-cardiac cause (P = 0.120). In this study, 2D echocardiography performed within 24 hours after ROSC was associated with better in-hospital survival outcomes for patients who underwent ICPR for IHCA with a cardiac aetiology. Thus, 2D echocardiography may be performed within 24 hours after ROSC in patients experiencing IHCA to enable better treatment.',\n",
       " 'The QX-type avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is still a prevalent genotype in Southwestern China. To analyze the antigenicity and pathogenicity characteristics of the dominant genotype strains (QX-type), S1 gene sequence analysis, virus cross-neutralization tests, and pathogenicity test of eight QX-type IBV isolates were conducted. Sequence analysis showed that the nucleotide homology between the eight strains was high, but distantly related to H120 and 4/91 vaccine strains. Cross-neutralization tests showed that all eight strains isolated from 2015 and 2017 belonged to the same serotype, but exhibited antigenic variations over time. The pathogenicity test of the five QX-type IBV isolates showed that only three strains, CK/CH/SC/DYW/16, CK/CH/SC/MS/17, and CK/CH/SC/GH/15, had a high mortality rate with strong respiratory and renal pathogenicity, whereas CK/CH/SC/PZ/17 and CK/CH/SC/DYYJ/17 caused only mild clinical symptoms and tissue lesions. Our results indicate that the prevalent QX-type IBVs displayed antigenic variations and pathogenicity difference. These findings may provide reference for research on the evolution of IBV and vaccine preparation of infectious bronchitis (IB).',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Prostaglandins (PG) are lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid metabolism. They are involved in cellular processes such as inflammation and tissue homeostasis. PG production is not restricted to multicellular organisms. Trypanosomatids also synthesize several metabolites of arachidonic acid. Nevertheless, their biological role in these early-branching parasites and their role in host-parasite interaction are not well elucidated. Prostaglandin F(2Î±) synthase (PGF2S) has been observed in the Leishmania braziliensis secreted proteome and in L. donovani extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, we previously reported a positive correlation between L. braziliensis PGF2S (LbrPGF2S) expression and pathogenicity in mice. METHODS: LbrPGF2S gene expression and PGF2Î± synthesis in promastigotes were detected and quantified by western blotting and EIA assay kit, respectively. To investigate LbrPGF2S localization in amastigotes during bone marrow-derived macrophage infection, parasites expressing mCherry-LbrPGF2S were generated and followed by time-lapse imaging for 48 h post-infection. PGF2S homolog sequences from Leishmania and humans were analyzed in silico using ClustalW on Geneious v6 and EMBOSS Needle. RESULTS: Leishmania braziliensis promastigotes synthesize prostaglandin F(2Î±) in the presence of arachidonic acid, with peak production in the stationary growth phase under heat stress. LbrPGF2S is a cytoplasmic protein enriched in the secretory site of the parasite cell body, the flagellar pocket. It is an enzyme constitutively expressed throughout promastigote development, but overexpression of LbrPGF2S leads to an increase of infectivity in vitro. The data suggest that LbrPGF2S may be released from intracellular amastigotes into the cytoplasm of bone marrow-derived macrophages over a 48-hour infection period, using time-lapse microscopy and mCherry-PGF2S (mChPGF2S)-expressing parasites. CONCLUSIONS: LbrPGF2S, a parasite-derived protein, is targeted to the host cell cytoplasm. The putative transfer of this enzyme, involved in pro-inflammatory lipid mediator synthesis, to the host cell suggests a potential role in host-parasite interaction and may partially explain the increased pathogenicity associated with overexpression of LbrPGF2S in L. braziliensis. Our data provide valuable insights to help understand the importance of parasite-derived lipid mediators in pathogenesis. [Image: see text]',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) whole-organism sporozoite vaccines have been shown to provide significant protection against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) in clinical trials. Initial CHMI studies showed significantly higher durable protection against homologous than heterologous strains, suggesting the presence of strain-specific vaccine-induced protection. However, interpretation of these results and understanding of their relevance to vaccine efficacy have been hampered by the lack of knowledge on genetic differences between vaccine and CHMI strains, and how these strains are related to parasites in malaria endemic regions. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing using long-read (Pacific Biosciences) and short-read (Illumina) sequencing platforms was conducted to generate de novo genome assemblies for the vaccine strain, NF54, and for strains used in heterologous CHMI (7G8 from Brazil, NF166.C8 from Guinea, and NF135.C10 from Cambodia). The assemblies were used to characterize sequences in each strain relative to the reference 3D7 (a clone of NF54) genome. Strains were compared to each other and to a collection of clinical isolates (sequenced as part of this study or from public repositories) from South America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia. RESULTS: While few variants were detected between 3D7 and NF54, we identified tens of thousands of variants between NF54 and the three heterologous strains. These variants include SNPs, indels, and small structural variants that fall in regulatory and immunologically important regions, including transcription factors (such as PfAP2-L and PfAP2-G) and pre-erythrocytic antigens that may be key for sporozoite vaccine-induced protection. Additionally, these variants directly contributed to diversity in immunologically important regions of the genomes as detected through in silico CD8(+) T cell epitope predictions. Of all heterologous strains, NF135.C10 had the highest number of unique predicted epitope sequences when compared to NF54. Comparison to global clinical isolates revealed that these four strains are representative of their geographic origin despite long-term culture adaptation; of note, NF135.C10 is from an admixed population, and not part of recently formed subpopulations resistant to artemisinin-based therapies present in the Greater Mekong Sub-region. CONCLUSIONS: These results will assist in the interpretation of vaccine efficacy of whole-organism vaccines against homologous and heterologous CHMI.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Knowledge about parasitic infections is crucial information for animal health, particularly of free-ranging species that might come into contact with livestock and humans. METHODS: We investigated the seroprevalence of three tissue-cyst-forming apicomplexan parasites (Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum and Besnoitia besnoiti) in 506 individuals of 12 wildlife species in Namibia using in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (indirect ELISAs applying purified antigens) for screening and immunoblots as confirmatory tests. We included six species of the suborder Feliformia, four species of the suborder Caniformia and two species of the suborder Ruminantia. For the two species for which we had most samples and life-history information, i.e. cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus, n = 250) and leopards (Panthera pardus, n = 58), we investigated T. gondii seroprevalence in relation to age class, sex, sociality (solitary, mother-offspring group, independent sibling group, coalition group) and site (natural habitat vs farmland). RESULTS: All but one carnivore species (bat-eared fox Otocyon megalotis, n = 4) were seropositive to T. gondii, with a seroprevalence ranging from 52.4% (131/250) in cheetahs to 93.2% (55/59) in African lions (Panthera leo). We also detected antibodies to T. gondii in 10.0% (2/20) of blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). Adult cheetahs and leopards were more likely to be seropositive to T. gondii than subadult conspecifics, whereas seroprevalence did not vary with sex, sociality and site. Furthermore, we measured antibodies to N. caninum in 15.4% (2/13) of brown hyenas (Hyaena brunnea) and 2.6% (1/39) of black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas). Antibodies to B. besnoiti were detected in 3.4% (2/59) of African lions and 20.0% (4/20) of blue wildebeest. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that Namibian wildlife species were exposed to apicomplexan parasites at different prevalences, depending on parasite and host species. In addition to serological work, molecular work is also needed to better understand the sylvatic cycle and the clear role of wildlife in the epidemiology of these parasites in southern Africa.',\n",
       " 'Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are sensor cells with diverse immune functions, from type I interferon (IFN-I) production to antigen presentation, T cell activation, and tolerance. Regulation of these functions remains poorly understood but could be mediated by functionally specialized pDC subpopulations. We address pDC diversity using a high-dimensional single-cell approach: mass cytometry (CyTOF). Our analysis uncovers a murine pDC-like population that specializes in antigen presentation with limited capacity for IFN-I production. Using a multifaceted cross-species comparison, we show that this pDC-like population is the definitive murine equivalent of the recently described human AXL(+) DCs, which we unify under the name transitional DCs (tDCs) given their continuum of pDC and cDC2 characteristics. tDCs share developmental traits with pDCs, as well as recruitment dynamics during viral infection. Altogether, we provide a framework for deciphering the function of pDCs and tDCs during diseases, which has the potential to open new avenues for therapeutic design.',\n",

       " 'During HIV infection, cell-to-cell transmission results in endosomal uptake of the virus by target CD4+ T cells and potential exposure of the viral ssRNA genome to endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are instrumental in activating inflammatory responses in innate immune cells, but their function in adaptive immune cells is less well understood. Here we show that synthetic ligands of TLR8 boosted T cell receptor signaling, resulting in increased cytokine production and upregulation of surface activation markers. Adjuvant TLR8 stimulation, but not TLR7 or TLR9, further promoted T helper cell differentiation towards Th1 and Th17. In addition, we found that endosomal HIV induced cytokine secretion from CD4+ T cells in a TLR8-specific manner. TLR8 engagement also enhanced HIV-1 replication and potentiated the reversal of latency in patient-derived T cells. The adjuvant TLR8 activity in T cells can contribute to viral dissemination in the lymph node and low-grade inflammation in HIV patients. In addition, it can potentially be exploited for therapeutic targeting and vaccine development.',\n",
       " 'The role of laparoscopic surgery for left-sided colon cancer has been supported by the results of randomized controlled trials. However, its benefits and disadvantages in the real world setting should be further assessed with population-based studies.The hospitalization data of patients undergoing open or laparoscopic surgery for left-sided colon cancer were sourced from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patient and hospital characteristics and perioperative outcomes including length of hospital stay, operation time, opioid use, blood transfusion, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and use of mechanical ventilation were compared. The overall survival was also assessed. Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery had shorter hospital stay (p < 0.0001) and less demand for opioid analgesia (p = 0.0005). Further logistic regression revealed that patients undergoing open surgery were 1.70, 2.89, and 3.00 times more likely to have blood transfusion, to be admitted to ICU, and to use mechanical ventilation than patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Operations performed in medical centers were also associated with less adverse events. The overall survival was comparable between the 2 groups.With adequate hospital quality and volume, laparoscopic surgery for left-sided colon cancer was associated with improved perioperative outcomes. The long-term survival was not compromised.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Spirochetal organisms of the Treponema genus are responsible for causing Treponematoses. Pathogenic treponemes is a Gram-negative, motile, spirochete pathogen that causes syphilis in human. Treponema pallidum subsp. endemicum (TEN) causes endemic syphilis (bejel); T. pallidum subsp. pallidum (TPA) causes venereal syphilis; T. pallidum subsp. pertenue (TPE) causes yaws; and T. pallidum subsp. Ccarateum causes pinta. Out of these four high morbidity diseases, venereal syphilis is mediated by sexual contact; the other three diseases are transmitted by close personal contact. The global distribution of syphilis is alarming and there is an increasing need of proper treatment and preventive measures. Unfortunately, effective measures are limited. RESULTS: Here, the genome sequences of 53 T. pallidum strains isolated from different parts of the world and a diverse range of hosts were comparatively analysed using pan-genomic strategy. Phylogenomic, pan-genomic, core genomic and singleton analysis disclosed the close connection among all strains of the pathogen T. pallidum, its clonal behaviour and showed increases in the sizes of the pan-genome. Based on the genome plasticity analysis of the subsets containing the subspecies T pallidum subsp. pallidum, T. pallidum subsp. endemicum and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue, we found differences in the presence/absence of pathogenicity islands (PAIs) and genomic islands (GIs) on subsp.-based study. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we identified four pathogenicity islands (PAIs), eight genomic islands (GIs) in subsp. pallidum, whereas subsp. endemicum has three PAIs and seven GIs and subsp. pertenue harbours three PAIs and eight GIs. Concerning the presence of genes in PAIs and GIs, we found some genes related to lipid and amino acid biosynthesis that were only present in the subsp. of T. pallidum, compared to T. pallidum subsp. endemicum and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies show that cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript prepropeptide (CARTPT) gene polymorphism modifies diet-obesity relationships. However, the interaction between CARTPT gene polymorphism and diet quality indices have not been investigated yet. The current study was aimed to evaluate the interaction between major dietary indices including Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 and CARTPT gene rs2239670 variants among apparently healthy obese Iranians. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out by employing 288 apparently healthy obese adults aged 20â\\x80\\x9350 years with a BMI of 30â\\x80\\x9340 kg/m(2). Diet quality was evaluated by Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I) and Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) using a 132-items semi-quantitative validated food frequency questionnaire. The CARTPT gene rs2239670 polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRâ\\x80\\x93RFLP) technique. Blood concentrations of glycemic markers, lipid profile, Î±-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) were also measured. ANCOVA multivariate interaction model was used to analyze gene-diet interactions. RESULTS: The significant interactions were identified between CARTPT gene polymorphism and HEI, affecting BMR (P(Interaction) = 0.003), serum glucose (P(Interaction) = 0.009) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL concentrations (P(Interaction) = 0.03) after adjusting for the effects of sex and age. Also we found gene-diet interaction between CARTPT genotypes and DQI-I in terms of fat mass (FM; P(Interaction) = 0.02), waist circumference (WC; P(Interaction) < 0.001), body mass index (BMI; P(Interaction) < 0.001), basal metabolic rate (BMR, P(Interaction) < 0.001), serum fasting glucose (P(Interaction) < 0.01) and AgRP (P(Interaction) = 0.05) in individuals even after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: Current study showed the effects of interaction between CARTPT genotype with adherence to HEI and DQI-I scores on obesity-related anthropometric and metabolic risk-factors.',\n",
       " 'The avian influenza virus outbreak in 1997 highlighted the potential of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus to cause severe disease in humans. Therefore, effective vaccines against H5N1 viruses are needed to counter the potential threat of a global pandemic. We have previously developed a fast-acting and efficacious vaccine against Ebola virus (EBOV) using the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) platform. In this study, we generated recombinant VSV-based H5N1 influenza virus vectors to demonstrate the feasibility of this platform for a fast-acting pan-H5 influenza virus vaccine. We chose multiple approaches regarding antigen design and genome location to define a more optimized vaccine approach. After the VSV-based H5N1 influenza virus constructs were recovered and characterized in vitro, mice were vaccinated by a single dose or prime/boost regimen followed by challenge with a lethal dose of the homologous H5 clade 1 virus. We found that a single dose of VSV vectors expressing full-length hemagglutinin (HAfl) were sufficient to provide 100% protection. The vaccine vectors were fast-acting as demonstrated by uniform protection when administered 3 days prior to lethal challenge. Moreover, single vaccination induced cross-protective H5-specific antibodies and protected mice against lethal challenge with various H5 clade 2 viruses, highlighting the potential of the VSV-based HAfl as a pan-H5 influenza virus emergency vaccine.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Optimal anti-bacterial activity of meropenem requires maintenance of its plasma concentration (Cp) above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the pathogen for at least 40% of the dosing interval (fT > MIC > 40). We aimed to determine whether a 3-h extended infusion (EI) of meropenem achieves fT > MIC > 40 on the first and third days of therapy in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. We also simulated the performance of the EI with respect to other pharmacokinetic (PK) targets such as fT > 4 Ã\\x97 MIC > 40, fT > MIC = 100, and fT > 4 Ã\\x97 MIC = 100. METHODS: Arterial blood samples of 25 adults with severe sepsis or septic shock receiving meropenem 1000 mg as a 3-h EI eight hourly (Q8H) were obtained at various intervals during and after the first and seventh doses. Plasma meropenem concentrations were determined using a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography assay, followed by modeling and simulation of PK data. European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) definitions of MIC breakpoints for sensitive and resistant Gram-negative bacteria were used. RESULTS: A 3-h EI of meropenem 1000 mg Q8H achieved fT > 2 Âµg/mL > 40 on the first and third days, providing activity against sensitive strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. However, it failed to achieve fT > 4 Âµg/mL > 40 to provide activity against strains susceptible to increased exposure in 33.3 and 39.1% patients on the first and the third days, respectively. Modeling and simulation showed that a bolus dose of 500 mg followed by 3-h EI of meropenem 1500 mg Q8H will achieve this target. A bolus of 500 mg followed by an infusion of 2000 mg would be required to achieve fT > 8 Âµg > 40. Targets of fT > 4 Âµg/mL = 100 and fT > 8 Âµg/mL = 100 may be achievable in two-thirds of patients by increasing the frequency of dosing to six hourly (Q6H). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, EI of 1000 mg of meropenem over 3 h administered Q8H is inadequate to provide activity (fT > 4 Âµg/mL > 40) against strains susceptible to increased exposure, which requires a bolus of 500 mg followed by EI of 1500 mg Q8H. While fT > 8 Âµg/mL > 40 require escalation of EI dose, fT > 4 Âµg/mL = 100 and fT > 8 Âµg/mL = 100 require escalation of both EI dose and frequency.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication can be detected in the respiratory secretions of a high proportion of ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, the clinical significance remains poorly defined. We investigated whether patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia not responding to antibiotics and in whom high levels of HSV could be detected in respiratory secretions benefit from acyclovir treatment. METHODS: Respiratory secretions (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or tracheal aspirates) were tested for HSV replication by quantitative real-time PCR. ICU survival times, clinical parameters, and radiographic findings were retrospectively compared between untreated and acyclovir treated patients with high (> 10(5) HSV copies/mL) and low (10(3)â\\x80\\x9310(5) HSV copies/mL) viral load. RESULTS: Fifty-seven low and 69 high viral load patients were identified. Fewer patients with high viral load responded to antibiotic treatment (12% compared to 40% of low load patients, p = 0.001). Acyclovir improved median ICU survival (8 vs 22 days, p = 0.014) and was associated with a significantly reduced hazard ratio for ICU death (HR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.11â\\x80\\x930.92, p = 0.035) in high load patients only. Moreover, circulatory and pulmonary oxygenation function of high load patients improved significantly over the course of acyclovir treatment: mean norepinephrine doses decreased from 0.05 to 0.02 Î¼g/kg body weight/min between days 0 and 6 of treatment (p = 0.049), and median PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increased from 187 to 241 between day 3 and day 7 of treatment (p = 0.02). Chest radiographic findings also improved significantly (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, antibiotic treatment failure, and high levels of HSV replication, acyclovir treatment was associated with a significantly longer time to death in the ICU and improved circulatory and pulmonary function. This suggests a causative role for HSV in this highly selected group of patients.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Predisposing conditions and risk modifiers instead of causes and risk factors have recently been used as alternatives to identify patients at a risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, data regarding risk modifiers among patients with non-pulmonary sepsis is rare. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the multicenter, prospective, Focused Outcomes Research in Emergency Care in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Sepsis and Trauma (FORECAST) cohort study that was conducted in 59 intensive care units (ICUs) in Japan during January 2016â\\x80\\x93March 2017. Adult patients with severe sepsis caused by non-pulmonary infection were included, and the primary outcome was having ARDS, defined as meeting the Berlin definition on the first or fourth day of screening. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to identify risk modifiers associated with ARDS, and odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals were reported. The following explanatory variables were then assessed: age, sex, admission source, body mass index, smoking status, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, steroid use, statin use, infection site, septic shock, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score. RESULTS: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 594 patients with non-pulmonary sepsis were enrolled, among whom 85 (14.3%) had ARDS. Septic shock was diagnosed in 80% of patients with ARDS and 66% of those without ARDS (p = 0.01). APACHE II scores were higher in patients with ARDS [26 (22â\\x80\\x9333)] than in those without ARDS [21 (16â\\x80\\x9328), p < 0.01]. In the multivariate logistic regression model, the following were independently associated with ARDS: ICU admission source [OR, 1.89 (1.06â\\x80\\x933.40) for emergency department compared with hospital wards], smoking status [OR, 0.18 (0.06â\\x80\\x930.59) for current smoking compared with never smoked], infection site [OR, 2.39 (1.04â\\x80\\x935.40) for soft tissue infection compared with abdominal infection], and APACHE II score [OR, 1.08 (1.05â\\x80\\x931.12) for higher compared with lower score]. CONCLUSIONS: Soft tissue infection, ICU admission from an emergency department, and a higher APACHE II score appear to be the risk modifiers of ARDS in patients with non-pulmonary sepsis.',\n",

The study aim was to investigate current SHI coverage and patientsâ\\x80\\x99 perspectives on this transition. METHODS: A survey of 1348 HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy (aged â\\x89¥18 years) was conducted at an HIV outpatient clinic at a central-level hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam, in October and November 2018. Insurance coverage, reasons for not having a SHI card, perceived concerns about receiving HIV services in SHI-registered local health facilities, and willingness to continue regularly visiting the current hospital were self-reported. Logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze factors associated with not having a SHI card and having concerns about receiving HIV services in SHI-registered hospitals/clinics. RESULTS: SHI coverage was 78.0%. The most frequently reported reason for not having a SHI card was that obtaining one was burdensome, followed by lack of information on how to obtain a card, and financial problems. Most patients (86.6%) had concerns about receiving HIV services at SHI-registered local health facilities, and disclosure of HIV status to neighbors and low quality of HIV services were the main concerns reported. Participants aged < 40 years old and unmarried were more likely to report lack of SHI cards, and women and those aged â\\x89¥40 years were more likely to have concerns. However, 91.4% of patients showed willingness to continue regular visits to the current hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Although SHI coverage has been rapidly improving among HIV patients, most participants had concerns about the current system transition in Vietnam. In response to their voiced concerns, strengthening the link between higher-level and lower-level facilities may help to ensure good quality HIV services at all levels while mitigating patientsâ\\x80\\x99 worries and anxieties.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Acute diarrhoea is a common cause of illness and death among children in low- to middle-income settings. World Health Organization guidelines for the clinical management of acute watery diarrhoea in children focus on oral rehydration, supplemental zinc and feeding advice. Routine use of antibiotics is not recommended except when diarrhoea is bloody or cholera is suspected. Young children who are undernourished or have a dehydrating diarrhoea are more susceptible to death at 90 days after onset of diarrhoea. Given the mortality risk associated with diarrhoea in children with malnutrition or dehydrating diarrhoea, expanding the use of antibiotics for this subset of children could be an important intervention to reduce diarrhoea-associated mortality and morbidity. We designed the Antibiotics for Childhood Diarrhoea (ABCD) trial to test this intervention. METHODS: ABCD is a double-blind, randomised trial recruiting 11,500 children aged 2â\\x80\\x9323 months presenting with acute non-bloody diarrhoea who are dehydrated and/or undernourished (i.e. have a high risk for mortality). Enrolled children in Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Pakistan and Tanzania are randomised (1:1) to oral azithromycin 10 mg/kg or placebo once daily for 3 days and followed-up for 180 days. Primary efficacy endpoints are all-cause mortality during the 180 days post-enrolment and change in linear growth 90 days post-enrolment. DISCUSSION: Expanding the treatment of acute watery diarrhoea in high-risk children to include an antibiotic may offer an opportunity to reduce deaths. These benefits may result from direct antimicrobial effects on pathogens or other incompletely understood mechanisms including improved nutrition, alterations in immune responsiveness or improved enteric function. The expansion of indications for antibiotic use raises concerns about the emergence of antimicrobial resistance both within treated children and the communities in which they live. ABCD will monitor antimicrobial resistance. The ABCD trial has important policy implications. If the trial shows significant benefits of azithromycin use, this may provide evidence to support reconsideration of antibiotic indications in the present World Health Organization diarrhoea management guidelines. Conversely, if there is no evidence of benefit, these results will support the current avoidance of antibiotics except in dysentery or cholera, thereby avoiding inappropriate use of antibiotics and reaffirming the current guidelines.

       " 'In this paper we introduce a single serotype transmission model, including an age-dependent mosquito biting rate, to find the optimal vaccination age against dengue in Brazil with Dengvaxia. The optimal vaccination age and minimal lifetime expected risk of hospitalisation are found by adapting a method due to Hethcote (Math Biosci 89:29â\\x80\\x9352). Any number and combination of the four dengue serotypes DENv1â\\x80\\x934 is considered. Successful vaccination against a serotype corresponds to a silent infection. The effects of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and permanent cross-immunity after two heterologous infections are studied. ADE is assumed to imply risk-free primary infections, while permanent cross-immunity implies risk-free tertiary and quaternary infections. Data from trials of Dengvaxia indicate vaccine efficacy to be age and serostatus dependent and vaccination of seronegative individuals to induce an increased risk of hospitalisation. Some of the scenarios are therefore reconsidered taking these findings into account. The optimal vaccination age is compared to that achievable under the current age restriction of the vaccine. If vaccination is not considered to induce risk, optimal vaccination ages are very low. The assumption of ADE generally leads to a higher optimal vaccination age in this case. For a single serotype vaccination is not recommended in the case of ADE. Permanent cross-immunity results in a slightly lower optimal vaccination age. If vaccination induces a risk, the optimal vaccination ages are much higher, particularly for permanent cross-immunity. ADE has no effect on the optimal vaccination age when permanent cross-immunity is considered; otherwise, it leads to a slight increase in optimal vaccination age.

       " 'BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the concordance between ventilator-associated events (VAE) and ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infections (VA-LRTI), and their impact on outcome. METHODS: This retrospective study was performed in five 10-bed ICUs of a teaching hospital, during a 2-year period. Ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infections (VA-LRTI), including ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were prospectively diagnosed. The agreement between VAE, VAT and VAP was assessed by k statistics. RESULTS: A total of 1059 patients (15,029 ventilator-days) were included. 268 VAP (17.8 per 1000 ventilator-days), 127 VAT (8.5 per 1000 ventilator-days) and 262 VAE (17.4 per 1000 ventilator-days) were diagnosed. There was no agreement between VAT and VAE, and the agreement was poor between VAP and VAE (k = 0.12, 95% CI 0.03â\\x80\\x930.20). VAE and VA-LRTI were associated with significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay. VAP, VAT and VAE were not significantly associated with mortality in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The agreement was poor between VAE and VAP. No agreement was found between VAE and VAT. VAE episodes were significantly associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay, but not with ICU mortality.',\n",
       " 'Sepsis is typically triggered by an overwhelming systemic inflammatory response to pathogens, and may lead to severe organ dysfunction and/or death. Sepsis consequently has a high mortality rate and a high rate of complications for survivors, despite modern medical advances. Therefore, drug identification and validation for the treatment of sepsis is of the utmost importance. As a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, rolipram also exhibits the abilities of inhibiting multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines production in macrophages and toxin-induced inflammation in mice. However, this drug has never been studied as a sepsis treatment method. We found that rolipram significantly improves survival in mice challenged with gram-negative bacterium E. coli, CLP, or E. coli derived lipopolysaccharide. We have also found that rolipram inhibits organ damage, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and intracellular migration of early-stage inflammatory elements. Our results also show that rolipram increases anti-inflammatory cytokine production. The protective effects of rolipram on septic mice may result from inhibition of the MAP kinase and NF-ÎºB signaling pathways. Rolipram may therefore be a potential novel sepsis treatment, one that would bypass the time-consuming and costly drug-discovery process.',\n",

Serotype, sequence type, clonality, antibiotic resistance genes and surface protein profiles of GBS are scarce in Ethiopia, a reason that this study was planned to investigate. . METHODS: Sixteen colonizing GBS isolates obtained from recto-vaginal swabs of pregnant women and body surfaces of newborns were further analyzed. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test, and whole genome sequence (WGS) methods were done for antibiotic susceptibility test, and molecular characterization of the isolates. RESULTS: All the GBS isolates analyzed were belonged to four capsular serotypes: II, 11/16(68.8%), V, 3/16(18.8%), Ia and VI each with 1/16(6.3%) and five sequence type (ST-2, ST-10, ST-14, ST-569 and ST-933). Sequence type-10 was the most predominant ST followed by ST-569. The five STs were grouped into the four clonal complexes (CC - 1, CC-10, CC-19, and CC-23). Different surface proteins and pili families such as ALP1, ALPHA, ALP23, PI-1 / PI-2A1, PI-1 / PI-2B, and Srr1 were detected from WGS data. All isolates were found to be susceptible to the tested antibiotics except for tetracycline in MIC and WGS test methods used. Tetracycline resistant determinant genes such as TETM and TETL / TETM combination were identified. CONCLUSION: Further studies on serotype and molecular epidemiology will provide a comprehensive data of the GBS capsular serotype and clones available in Ethiopia.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a bridge to lung transplantation has greatly increased. However, data regarding the clinical outcomes of this approach are lacking. The objective of this multicenter prospective observational cohort study was to evaluate lung transplantation outcomes in Korean Organ Transplantation Registry (KOTRY) patients for whom ECMO was used as a bridge to transplantation. METHODS: Between March 2015 and December 2017, a total of 112 patients received lung transplantation and were registered in the KOTRY, which is a prospective, multicenter cohort registry. The entire cohort was divided into two groups: the control group (n = 85, 75.9%) and bridge-ECMO group (n = 27, 24.1%). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in pre-transplant and intraoperative characteristics except for poorer oxygenation, more ventilator use, and longer operation time in the bridge-ECMO group. The prevalence of primary graft dysfunction at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after transplantation did not differ between the two groups. Although postoperative hospital stays were longer in the bridge-ECMO group than in the control group, hospital mortality did not differ between the two groups (25.9% vs. 13.3%, P = 0.212). The majority of patients (70.4% of the bridge-ECMO group and 77.6% of the control group) were discharged directly to their homes. Finally, the use of ECMO as a bridge to lung transplantation did not significantly affect overall survival and graft function. CONCLUSIONS: Short- and long-term post-transplant outcomes of bridge-ECMO patients were comparable to recipients who did not receive ECMO.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is commonly encountered in critically ill adults. Evidence evaluating the association between NOAF and patient-important outcomes in this population is conflicting. Furthermore, little is known regarding the association between NOAF and resource use or hospital costs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis (2011â\\x80\\x932016) of a prospectively collected registry from two Canadian hospitals of consecutive ICU patients aged â\\x89¥ 18 years. We excluded patients with a known history of AF prior to hospital admission. Any occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) was prospectively recorded by bedside nurses. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, and we used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for confounders. We used a generalized linear model to evaluate contributors to total cost. RESULTS: We included 15,014 patients, and 1541 (10.3%) had NOAF during their ICU admission. While NOAF was not associated with increased odds of hospital death among the entire cohort (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.02 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97â\\x80\\x931.08]), an interaction was noted between NOAF and sepsis, and the presence of both was associated with higher odds of hospital mortality (aOR 1.28 [95% CI 1.09â\\x80\\x931.36]) than either alone. Patients with NOAF had higher total costs (cost ratio [CR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.02â\\x80\\x931.20]). Among patients with NOAF, treatment with a rhythm-control strategy was associated with higher costs (CR 1.24 [95% CI 1.07â\\x80\\x931.40]). CONCLUSIONS: While NOAF was not associated with death or requiring discharge to long-term care among critically ill patients, it was associated with increased length of stay in ICU and increased total costs.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The present study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of an influenza vaccination program for children in the Netherlands. This requires an evaluation of the long-term impact of such a program on the burden of influenza across all age groups, using a transmission model that accounts for the seasonal variability in vaccine effectiveness and the shorter duration of protection following vaccination as compared to natural infection. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a stochastic dynamic transmission model that has been calibrated to reported GP visits with influenza-like illness in the Netherlands over 11 seasons (2003/2004 to 2014/2015). We analyzed the costs and effects of extending the current program with vaccination of children aged 2â\\x80\\x9316 years at 50% coverage over 20 consecutive seasons. We measured the effects in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and we adopted a societal perspective. RESULTS: The childhood vaccination program is estimated to have an average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of â\\x82¬3944 per QALY gained and is cost-effective in the general population (across 1000 simulations; conventional Dutch threshold of â\\x82¬20,000 per QALY gained). The childhood vaccination program is not estimated to be cost-effective for the target-group itself with an average ICER of â\\x82¬57,054 per QALY gained. Uncertainty analyses reveal that these ICERs hide a wide range of outcomes. Even though introduction of a childhood vaccination program decreases the number of infections, it tends to lead to larger epidemics: in 23.3% of 1000 simulations, the childhood vaccination program results in an increase in seasons with a symptomatic attack rate larger than 5%, which is expected to cause serious strain on the health care system. In 6.4% of 1000 simulations, the childhood vaccination program leads to a net loss of QALYs. These findings are robust across different targeted age groups and vaccination coverages. CONCLUSIONS: Modeling indicates that childhood influenza vaccination is cost-effective in the Netherlands. However, childhood influenza vaccination is not cost-effective when only outcomes for the children themselves are considered. In approximately a quarter of the simulations, the introduction of a childhood vaccination program increases the frequency of seasons with a symptomatic attack rate larger than 5%. The possibility of an overall health loss cannot be excluded.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUNDS: The aim of this study is investigating the benefits and harms of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: We comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library for randomized controlled trials comparing NMBAs to any other comparator. We pooled data using relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals. We assessed the quality of included studies using the Cochrane tool and levels of evidence using the GRADE method. RESULTS: Finally, six RCTs (n = 1557 patients) were eligible for analysis. The results showed NMBAs use was not associated with reduced 28 days mortality (RR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.06; P = 0.11), 90 days mortality (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.04; P = 0.16), and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.03; P = 0.13) in patients with ARDS. However, 21â\\x80\\x9328 days mortality was slightly lower in patients received NMBAs (RR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.99; P = 0.04; I(2) = 53%). Besides, NMBAs use could improve the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio at 48 and 72 h, decrease plateau pressure and PEEP at 72 h. Additionally, NMBAs had no significant effects on days free of ventilation at day 28 (WMD, 0.55; 95% CI, â\\x88\\x92 0.46 to 1.57; P = 0.29), days not in ICU at day 28 (WMD, 0.12; 95% CI, â\\x88\\x92 0.85 to 1.08; P = 0.82), ICU-acquired weakness (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.93; P = 0.06). Finally, NMBAs use was associated with a lower risk of barotrauma (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.85; P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: In patients with respiratory distress syndrome, NMBAs may be beneficial in reverse refractory hypoxemia and may be associated with reduced short-term mortality and incidence of barotrauma. However, there is no significant effects of NMBAs on mid-term and long-term mortality, and further studies are required.',\n",
       " 'The central role that erythrocyte invasion plays in Plasmodium falciparum survival and reproduction makes this process an attractive target for therapeutic or vaccine development. However, multiple invasion-related genes with complementary and overlapping functions afford the parasite the plasticity to vary ligands used for invasion, leading to phenotypic variation and immune evasion. Overcoming the challenge posed by redundant ligands requires a deeper understanding of conditions that select for variant phenotypes and the molecular mediators. While host factors including receptor heterogeneity and acquired immune responses may drive parasite phenotypic variation, we have previously shown that host-independent changes in invasion phenotype can be achieved by continuous culturing of the W2mef and Dd2 P. falciparum strains in moving suspension as opposed to static conditions. Here, we have used a highly biologically replicated whole transcriptome sequencing approach to identify the molecular signatures of variation associated with the phenotype switch. The data show increased expression of particular invasion-related genes in switched parasites, as well as a large number of genes encoding proteins that are either exported or form part of the export machinery. The genes with most markedly increased expression included members of the erythrocyte binding antigens (EBA), reticulocyte binding homologues (RH), surface associated interspersed proteins (SURFIN), exported protein family 1 (EPF1) and Plasmodium Helical Interspersed Sub-Telomeric (PHIST) gene families. The data indicate changes in expression of a repertoire of genes not previously associated with erythrocyte invasion phenotypes, suggesting the possibility that moving suspension culture may also select for other traits.',\n",
       " 'To investigate CTL epitope applications in swine, SLA-1(*)1502-restricted peptide epitopes matching porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strains were explored by crystallography, biochemistry, and the specific pathogen-free (SPF) swine experiments. First, nine predicted PRRSV peptides were tested by assembly of the peptide-SLA-1(*)1502 (pSLA-1(*)1502) complexes, and the crystal structure of the SLA-1(*)1502 complex with one peptide (NSP9-TMP9) was determined. The NSP9-TMP9 peptide conformation presented by pSLA-1(*)1502 is different from that of the peptides presented by the known pSLA-1(*)0401 and pSLA-3(*)hs0202 complexes. Two consecutive Pro residues make the turn between P3 and P4 of NSP9-TMP9 much sharper. The D pocket of pSLA-1(*)1502 is unique and is important for peptide binding. Next, the potential SLA-1(*)1502-restricted peptide epitopes matching four typical genetic PRRSV strains were identified based on the peptide-binding motif of SLA-1(*)1502 determined by structural analysis and alanine scanning of the NSP9-TMP9 peptide. The tetrameric complex of SLA-1(*)1502 and NSP9-TMP9 was constructed and examined. Finally, taking NSP9-TMP9 as an example, the CTL immunogenicity of the identified PRRSV peptide epitope was evaluated. The SPF swine expressing the SLA-1(*)1502 alleles were divided into three groups: modified live vaccine (MLV), MLV+NSP9-TMP9, and the blank control group. NSP9-TMP9 was determined as a PRRSV CTL epitope with strong immunogenicity by flow cytometry and IFN-Î³ expression. Our study developed an integrated approach to identify SLA-I-restricted CTL epitopes from various important viruses and is helpful in designing and applying effective peptide-based vaccines for swine.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of breast cancer patients develop metastatic disease, with over 450,000 deaths globally per year. Bone is the most common first site of metastatic disease accounting for 40% of all first recurrence and 70% of patients with advanced disease develop skeletal involvement. Treatment of bone metastases currently focusses on symptom relief and prevention and treatment of skeletal complications. However, there remains a need for further treatment options for patients with bone metastases. Combining systemic therapy with a bone-targeted agent, such as radium-223, may provide an effective treatment with minimal additional side effects. METHODS/DESIGN: CARBON is a UK-based, open-label, multi-centre study which comprises an initial safety phase to establish the feasibility and safety of combining radium-223 given on a 6-weekly schedule in combination with orally administered capecitabine followed by a randomised extension phase to further characterise the safety profile and provide preliminary estimation of efficacy. DISCUSSION: The CARBON study is important as the results will be the first to assess radium-223 with chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. If the results find acceptable rates of toxicity with a decrease in bone turnover markers, further work will be necessary in a phase II/III setting to assess the efficacy and clinical benefit.

       " 'INTRODUCTION: Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for older adults, but evidence regarding the impact of repeated vaccination has been inconclusive. AIM: We investigated vaccine effectiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza and the impact of repeated vaccination over 10 previous seasons on current season VE among older adults. METHODS: We conducted an observational test-negative study in community-dwelling adults aged > 65 years in Ontario, Canada for the 2010/11 to 2015/16 seasons by linking laboratory and health administrative data. We estimated VE using multivariable logistic regression. We assessed the impact of repeated vaccination by stratifying by previous vaccination history. RESULTS: We included 58,304 testing episodes for respiratory viruses, with 11,496 (20%) testing positive for influenza and 31,004 (53%) vaccinated. Adjusted VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza for the six seasons combined was 21% (95% confidence interval (CI): 18 to 24%). Patients who were vaccinated in the current season, but had received no vaccinations in the previous 10 seasons, had higher current season VE (34%; 95%CI: 9 to 52%) than patients who had received 1â\\x80\\x933 (26%; 95%CI: 13 to 37%), 4â\\x80\\x936 (24%; 95%CI: 15 to 33%), 7â\\x80\\x938 (13%; 95%CI: 2 to 22%), or 9â\\x80\\x9310 (7%; 95%CI: â\\x88\\x924 to 16%) vaccinations (trend test p = 0.001). All estimates were higher after correcting for misclassification of current season vaccination status. For patients who were not vaccinated in the current season, residual protection rose significantly with increasing numbers of vaccinations received previously. CONCLUSIONS: Although VE appeared to decrease with increasing numbers of previous vaccinations, current season vaccination likely provides some protection against influenza regardless of the number of vaccinations received over the previous 10 influenza seasons.',\n",
       " 'Mechanical ventilation induces lung injury by damaging alveolar epithelial cells (AECs), but the pathogenesis remains unknown. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase that is involved in cell growth and intracellular signal transduction pathways. This study explored the potential role of FAK in AECs during lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation. High-volume mechanical ventilation (HMV) was used to create a mouse lung injury model, which was validated by analysis of lung weight, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and histological investigation. The expression of FAK and Akt in AECs were evaluated. In addition, recombinant FAK was administered to mice via the tail vein, and then the extent of lung injury was assessed. Mouse AECs were cultured in vitro, and FAK expression in cells under stretch was investigated. The effects of FAK on cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis were investigated. The results showed that HMV decreased FAK expression in AECs of mice, while FAK supplementation attenuated lung injury, reduced protein levels/cell counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and decreased histological lung injury and oedema. The protective effect of FAK promoted AEC proliferation and migration and prevented cells from undergoing apoptosis, which restored the integrity of the alveoli through Akt pathway. Therefore, the decrease in FAK expression by HMV is essential for injury to epithelial cells and the disruption of alveolar integrity. FAK supplementation can reduce AEC injury associated with HMV.',\n",
       " 'We have previously demonstrated that a recombinant Listeria ivanovii (LI) strain expressing the ESAT-6 or Ag85C protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as a tuberculosis (TB) vaccine candidates induced antigen-specific cellular immune responses after intravenous immunization of mice. However, whether such recombinant strains could induce desired immune responses in the lung, where TB infection occurs, is not clear. In this paper, C57BL/6 J mice were intranasally vaccinated with attenuated LIÎ\\x94actAplcB-Rv3875 (Î\\x94 refers to gene deletion in the bacterial genome) or LIÎ\\x94actAplcB-Rv0129c, the two vaccine candidates that utilize LI as an antigen delivery vector. Bacterial load in the target organs, histological changes in the infected organs, the percentage of specific cytokine-secreting T cells in the lung and spleen, IgG levels in the serum and secretory IgA (SIgA) levles in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were determined at specific days post inoculation (dpi). The results showed that both strains were mainly confined to the lung and were eliminated at 10 dpi. The histological damage caused by the infection in the lung was slight and recovered by day 5. Intranasal vaccination of the mice twice at an interval of 4 weeks notably elicited TB antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses in the lung and SIgA secretion in the pulmonary mucosa, and significantly enhanced the percentage of double-functional CD8(+) T cells (IFN-Î³(+) TNF-Î±(+) CD8(+)). To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the used of LI vector vaccines to induce promising lung-localized cellular and humoral immune responses by intranasal vaccination. These data suggest that LI could be a novel and promising live vector to construct an intranasal vaccine against respiratory diseases.',\n",
       " 'The Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte surface protein, Pfs48/45, is a potential target for malaria transmission-blocking vaccines. However, due to its size and complexity, expression of the full-length protein has been difficult, leading to focus on the C-terminal six cysteine domain (6C) with the use of fusion proteins to facilitate expression and folding. In this study, we utilized the baculovirus system to evaluate the expression of three Pfs48/45 proteins including the full-length protein, the 6C domain fragment and the 6C domain mutant to prevent glycosylation. Expression of the recombinant Pfs48/45 proteins was conducted in super Sf9 cells combined with the use of tunicamycin to prevent N-glycosylation. The proteins were then evaluated as immunogens in mice to demonstrate the induction of functionally active polyclonal antibody responses as measured in the standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA). Only the 6C protein was found to exhibit significant transmission-reducing activity. Further characterization of the biologically active 6C protein demonstrated it was homogeneous in terms of size, charge, conformation, absence of glycosylation, and containing proper disulfide bond pairings. This study presents an alternative expression system, without the need of a fusion protein partner, for the Pfs48/45 6C protein fragment including further evaluation as a potential transmission-blocking vaccine candidate.',\n",

Estimating the growth rate from the epidemic curve can be a challenge, because of its decays with time.

       " 'Antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) is one of the most important strategies for managing infectious disease treatment and preventing antimicrobial resistance. The successful implementation of ASP in the community health system (CHS) has been challenging. We evaluated perceptions of current ASP, potential setbacks of ASP implementation, and future demands on ASP services among physicians and pharmacists in the CHS. The qualitative research was conducted through in-depth individual interviews and focus group discussions with 11 physicians and 11 pharmacists. In addition, a quantitative gap analysis was conducted to assess the different awareness and demands on services of ASP and preferred antimicrobial-related problems (ARP). In overall, perceptions of ASP varied by profession. The identified setbacks were unorganized institutional leadership, the undefined roles of healthcare professionals, a lack of reimbursement, the hierarchical structure of the health system, and the labor-intensive working environment of pharmacy services. Although demands for ASP improvement were similar among professionals, they had different preferences in prioritizing each service item of ASP/ARP development and the profession responsible for each service. Continuous administrative and financial investments, understanding ASP contents, ASP-specific information technology, and interdisciplinary collaboration with good communication among healthcare professions are needed to continue the progression of ASP.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen with a notorious reputation of being resistant to antimicrobial agents. The capability of A. baumannii to persist and disseminate between healthcare settings has raised a major concern worldwide. METHODS: Our study investigated the antibiotic resistance features and molecular epidemiology of 52 clinical isolates of A. baumannii collected in Pakistan between 2013 and 2015. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined by the agar disc diffusion method. Comparative sequence analyses of the ampC and bla(OXA-51-like) alleles were used to assign the isolates into clusters. The whole genomes of 25 representative isolates were sequenced using the MiSeq Desktop Sequencer. Free online applications were used to determine the phylogeny of genomic sequences, retrieve the multilocus sequence types (ST), and detect acquired antimicrobial resistance genes. RESULTS: Overall, the isolates were grouped into 7 clusters and 3 sporadic isolates. The largest cluster, Ab-Pak-cluster-1 (bla(OXA-66) and ISAba1-ampC-19) included 24 isolates, belonged to ST2 and International clone (IC) II, and was distributed between two geographical far-off cities, Lahore and Peshawar. Ab-Pak-clusters-2 (bla(OXA-66), ISAba1-ampC-2), and -3 (bla(OXA-66), ISAba1-ampC-20) and the individual isolate Ab-Pak-Lah-01 (ISAba1-bla(OXA-66), ISAba1-ampC-2) were also assigned to ST2 and IC II. On the other hand, Ab-Pak-clusters-4 (bla(OXA-69), ampC-1), -5 (bla(OXA-69), ISAba1-ampC-78), and -6A (bla(OXA-371), ISAba1-ampC-3) belonged to ST1, while Ab-Pak-cluster-6B (bla(OXA-371), ISAba1-ampC-8) belonged to ST1106, with both ST1 and ST1106 being members of IC I. Five isolates belonged to Ab-Pak-cluster-7 (bla(OXA-65), ampC-43). This cluster corresponded to ST158, showed a well-delineated position on the genomic phylogenetic tree, and was equipped with several antimicrobial resistance genes including bla(OXA-23) and bla(GES-11). CONCLUSIONS: Our study detected the occurrence of 7 clusters of A. baumannii in Pakistan. Altogether, 6/7 of the clusters and 45/52 (86.5%) of the isolates belonged to IC I (n = 9) or II (n = 36), making Pakistan no exception to the global domination of these two clones. The onset of ST158 in Pakistan marked a geographical dispersal of this clone beyond the Middle East and brought up the need for a detailed characterization.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: In endemic areas, pregnant women are highly susceptible to Plasmodium falciparum malaria characterized by the accumulation of parasitized red blood cells (pRBC) in the placenta. In subsequent pregnancies, women develop protective immunity to pregnancy-associated malaria and this has been hypothesized to be due to the acquisition of antibodies to the parasite variant surface antigen VAR2CSA. In this systematic review we provide the first synthesis of the association between antibodies to pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens and pregnancy and birth outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies (published up to 07 June 2019) of pregnant women living in P. falciparum endemic areas that examined antibody responses to pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens and outcomes including placental malaria, low birthweight, preterm birth, peripheral parasitaemia, maternal anaemia, and severe malaria. RESULTS: We searched 6 databases and identified 33 studies (30 from Africa) that met predetermined inclusion and quality criteria: 16 studies contributed estimates in a format enabling inclusion in meta-analysis and 17 were included in narrative form only. Estimates were mostly from cross-sectional data (10 studies) and were heterogeneous in terms of magnitude and direction of effect. Included studies varied in terms of antigens tested, methodology used to measure antibody responses, and epidemiological setting. Antibody responses to pregnancy-specific pRBC and VAR2CSA antigens, measured at delivery, were associated with placental malaria (9 studies) and may therefore represent markers of infection, rather than correlates of protection. Antibody responses to pregnancy-specific pRBC, but not recombinant VAR2CSA antigens, were associated with trends towards protection from low birthweight (5 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Whilst antibody responses to several antigens were positively associated with the presence of placental and peripheral infections, this review did not identify evidence that any specific antibody response is associated with protection from pregnancy-associated malaria across multiple populations. Further prospective cohort studies using standardized laboratory methods to examine responses to a broad range of antigens in different epidemiological settings and throughout the gestational period, will be necessary to identify and prioritize pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens to advance the development of vaccines and serosurveillance tools targeting pregnant women.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment duration for patients with bloodstream infection is understudied. The Bacteremia Antibiotic Length Actually Needed for Clinical Effectiveness (BALANCE) pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) determined that it was feasible to enroll and randomize intensive care unit (ICU) patients with bloodstream infection to 7 versus 14 days of treatment, and served as the vanguard for the ongoing BALANCE main RCT. We performed this BALANCE-Ward pilot RCT to examine the feasibility and impact of potentially extending the BALANCE main RCT to include patients hospitalized on non-ICU wards. METHODS: We conducted an open pilot RCT among a subset of six sites participating in the ongoing BALANCE RCT, randomizing patients with positive non-Staphylococcus aureus blood cultures on non-ICU wards to 7 versus 14 days of antibiotic treatment. The co-primary feasibility outcomes were recruitment rate and adherence to treatment duration protocol. We compared feasibility outcomes, patient/pathogen characteristics, and overall outcomes among those enrolled in this BALANCE-Ward and prior BALANCE-ICU pilot RCTs. We estimated the sample size and non-inferiority margin impacts of expanding the BALANCE main RCT to include non-ICU patients. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients were recruited over 47 site-months (mean 2.9 patients/site-month, median 1.0, range 0.1â\\x80\\x934.4 patients/site-month). The overall recruitment rate exceeded the BALANCE-ICU pilot RCT (mean 1.10 patients/site-month, p < 0.0001). Overall protocol adherence also exceeded the adherence in the BALANCE-ICU pilot RCT (125/134, 93% vs 89/115, 77%, p = 0.0003). BALANCE-Ward patients were older, with lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, and higher proportions of infections caused by Escherichia coli and genito-urinary sources of bloodstream infection. The BALANCE-Ward pilot RCT patients had an overall 90-day mortality rate of 17/133 (12.8%), which was comparable to the 90-day mortality rate in the ICU pilot RCT (17/115, 14.8%) (p = 0.65). Simulation models indicated there would be minimal sample size and non-inferiority margin implications of expanding enrolment to increasing proportions of non-ICU versus ICU patients. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to enroll non-ICU patients in a trial of 7 versus 14 days of antibiotics for bloodstream infection, and expanding the BALANCE RCT hospital-wide has the potential to improve the timeliness and generalizability of trial results.

       " 'Standard inactivated influenza vaccines are poorly immunogenic in immunologically naive healthy young children, who are particularly vulnerable to complications from influenza. For them, there is an unmet need for better influenza vaccines. Oil-in-water emulsion-adjuvanted influenza vaccines are promising candidates, but clinical trials yielded inconsistent results. Here, we meta-analyze randomized controlled trials with efficacy data (3 trials, n = 15,310) and immunogenicity data (17 trials, n = 9062). Compared with non-adjuvanted counterparts, adjuvanted influenza vaccines provide a significantly better protection (weighted estimate for risk ratio of RT-PCR-confirmed influenza: 0.26) and are significantly more immunogenic (weighted estimates for seroprotection rate ratio: 4.6 to 7.9) in healthy immunologically naive young children. Nevertheless, in immunologically non-naive children, adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccines provide similar protection and are similarly immunogenic. These results indicate that oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant improves the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines in healthy young children at the first-time seasonal influenza vaccination.',\n",
       " 'An abnormal elevation in pressure is a serious complication involving the extracorporeal circulation circuit. Clot formation might be associated with this complication, but the precise mechanism of an abnormal elevation in pressure has not been identified. We investigated sufficient conditions for in-circuit elevation in pressure using an ex vivo re-circulation circuit with porcine blood. Specifically, we investigated the effect of blood conditions, the type of anticoagulation, and pro-inflammatory stimulation on in-circuit pressure. We also examined the cause of an abnormal elevation of in-circuit pressure by specifically degrading DNA, RNA, or protein components of an obstructed filter and by using immunofluorescent techniques. Neither a change in temperature nor change in pH in the blood increased in-circuit pressure. In contrast, long-term storage of blood, pro-inflammatory stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate, and heparin administration significantly increased in-circuit pressure. Abnormal in-circuit elevation in pressure was associated with deposition of extracellular DNA on the outlet surface of the filter. Administration of DNase resulted in a rapid decline of in-circuit pressure. In an ex vivo re-circulation circuit system, extracellular DNA deposition on the filter is responsible for an abnormal in-circuit elevation in pressure. Senescent leukocytes, stimulated leukocytes, and heparin exposure are associated with extracellular DNA deposition.',\n",
       " 'To investigate the evolution of lung function in preterm infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and to determine the perinatal characteristics associated with indexes of lung function in later infancy. Longitudinal lung function assessments were performed at approximately 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of corrected age in preterm infants. Perinatal characteristics were further analyzed to ascertain the determinants of lung function indexes. Although all preterm infants (n = 121; 61 without BPD and 60 with BPD) exhibited decreased lung function in early infancy (6 months of age), after body length was adjusted for, only infants with BPD exhibited poor performance. Furthermore, the lung function of infants with mild to moderate BPD caught up gradually, but the generally poor lung function performance of infants with severe BPD, especially in forced expiratory flow, persisted until later age (24 months). Regarding perinatal characteristics, the z-score of body length at the time of examination and total number of days on positive-pressure ventilation are the major determinants of lung function in later infancy.',\n",
       " 'Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne member of the Flaviviridae family that has been known to circulate for decades causing mild febrile illness. The more recent ZIKV outbreaks in the Americas and the Caribbean associated with congenital malformations and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome in adults have placed public health officials in high alert and highlight the significant impact of ZIKV on human health. New technologies to study the biology of ZIKV and to develop more effective prevention options are highly desired. In this study we demonstrate that direct delivery in mice of an infectious ZIKV cDNA clone allows the rescue of recombinant (r)ZIKV in vivo. A bacterial artificial chromosome containing the sequence of ZIKV strain Paraiba/2015 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was complexed with a commercial transfection reagent and administrated using different routes in type-I interferon receptor deficient A129 mice. Clinical signs and death associated with ZIKV viremia were observed in mice. The rZIKV recovered from these mice remained fully virulent in a second passage in mice. Interestingly, infectious rZIKV was also recovered after intraperitoneal inoculation of the rZIKV cDNA in the absence of transfection reagent. Further expanding these studies, we demonstrate that a single intraperitoneal inoculation of a cDNA clone encoding an attenuated rZIKV was safe, highly immunogenic, and provided full protection against lethal ZIKV challenge. This novel in vivo reverse genetics method is a potentially suitable delivery platform for the study of wild-type and live-attenuated ZIKV devoid of confounding factors typical associated with in vitro systems. Moreover, our results open the possibility of employing similar in vivo reverse genetic approaches for the generation of other viruses and, therefore, change the way we will use reverse genetics in the future.',\n",
       " 'A fast Endospore Germinability Assay (EGA) was validated with traditional plate counts to enumerate single endospore germination events for monitoring surface sterilization. The assay is based on a time-gated luminescence microscopy technique enabling visualization and enumeration of individual germinating endospores. Germinating endospores release calcium dipicolinate to form highly luminescent terbium dipicolinate complexes surrounding each germinating endospore. EGA and heterotrophic plate counting (HPC) were used to evaluate the swab/rinse recovery efficiency of endospores from stainless steel surfaces. EGA and HPC results were highly correlated for endospore recovery from stainless steel coupons inoculated with range of 1,000 endospores per coupon down to sterility. Dosage-dependent decrease of surface endospore germinability were observed in dry heat, UV irradiation, oxygen plasma and vaporized hydrogen peroxide treatments, measured with EGA and HPC. EGA is a fast and complementary method to traditional HPC for quantitative sterility assurance testing of surfaces. This work introduces and validates a 15-minute or faster assay for germinable endospores to complement the conventional lengthy, culture-based surface sterility validation, which is critical in hospitals, food and pharmaceutical industries to help minimize nosocomial infection, food spoilage, and pharmaceutical contamination.',\n",
       " 'The regulation of ubiquitination status in the cell is controlled by ubiquitin ligases acting in tandem with deubiquitinating enzymes. Ubiquitination controls many key processes in the cell from division to death making its tight regulation key to optimal cell function. Activity based protein profiling has emerged as a powerful technique to study these important enzymes. With around 100 deubiquitinating enzymes and 600 ubiquitin ligases in the human genome targeting a subclass of these enzymes or even a single enzyme is a compelling strategy to unpick this complex system. In this review we will discuss different approaches adopted, including activity-based probes centered around ubiquitin-protein, ubiquitin-peptide and mutated ubiquitin scaffolds. We examine challenges faced and opportunities presented to increase specificity in activity-based protein profiling of the ubiquitin conjugation/deconjugation machinery.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Young women in sub-Saharan Africa remain at the epicentre of the HIV epidemic, with surveillance data indicating persistent high levels of HIV incidence. In South Africa, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) account for a quarter of all new HIV infections. Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe (DREAMS) is a strategy introduced by the United States Presidentâ\\x80\\x99s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) aimed at reducing HIV incidence among AGYW in 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa by 25% in the programmeâ\\x80\\x99s first year, and by 40% in the second year. This study will assess the change in HIV incidence and reduction in risk associated behaviours that can be attributed to the DREAMS initiative in South Africa, using a population-based cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Data will be collected from a household-based representative sample of AGYW (between the ages 12â\\x80\\x9324 years) in four high prevalence districts (more than 10% of the population have HIV in these districts) in South Africa in which DREAMS has been implemented. A stratified cluster-based sampling approach will be used to select eligible participants for a cross-sectional survey with 18,500, to be conducted over 2017/2018. A questionnaire will be administered containing questions on sexual risk behaviour, selected academic and developmental milestones, prevalence of gender based violence, whilst examining exposure to DREAMS programmes. Biological samples, including two micro-containers of blood and self-collected vulvovaginal swab samples, are collected in each survey to test for HIV infection, HIV incidence, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy. This study will measure trends in population level HIV incidence using the Limiting antigen (LAg) Avidity Enzyme Immuno-Assay (EIA) and monitor changes in HIV incidence. DISCUSSION: Ending the HIV/AIDS pandemic by 2030 requires the continual monitoring and evaluation of prevention programmes, with the aim of optimising efforts and ensuring the achievement of epidemic control. This study will determine the impact DREAMS interventions have had on HIV incidence among AGYW in a â\\x80\\x98real world, non-trial settingâ\\x80\\x99.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae is a leading cause of bloodstream infection (BSI). Strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or carbapenemases are considered global priority pathogens for which new treatment and prevention strategies are urgently required, due to severely limited therapeutic options. South and Southeast Asia are major hubs for antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) K. pneumoniae and also for the characteristically antimicrobial-sensitive, community-acquired â\\x80\\x9chypervirulentâ\\x80\\x9d strains. The emergence of hypervirulent AMR strains and lack of data on exopolysaccharide diversity pose a challenge for K. pneumoniae BSI control strategies worldwide. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective genomic epidemiology study of 365 BSI K. pneumoniae from seven major healthcare facilities across South and Southeast Asia, extracting clinically relevant information (AMR, virulence, K and O antigen loci) using Kleborate, a K. pneumoniae-specific genomic typing tool. RESULTS: K. pneumoniae BSI isolates were highly diverse, comprising 120 multi-locus sequence types (STs) and 63 K-loci. ESBL and carbapenemase gene frequencies were 47% and 17%, respectively. The aerobactin synthesis locus (iuc), associated with hypervirulence, was detected in 28% of isolates. Importantly, 7% of isolates harboured iuc plus ESBL and/or carbapenemase genes. The latter represent genotypic AMR-virulence convergence, which is generally considered a rare phenomenon but was particularly common among South Asian BSI (17%). Of greatest concern, we identified seven novel plasmids carrying both iuc and AMR genes, raising the prospect of co-transfer of these phenotypes among K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: K. pneumoniae BSI in South and Southeast Asia are caused by different STs from those predominating in other regions, and with higher frequency of acquired virulence determinants. K. pneumoniae carrying both iuc and AMR genes were also detected at higher rates than have been reported elsewhere. The study demonstrates how genomics-based surveillanceâ\\x80\\x94reporting full molecular profiles including STs, AMR, virulence and serotype locus informationâ\\x80\\x94can help standardise comparisons between sites and identify regional differences in pathogen populations.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Inadequate hospital cleaning may contribute to cross-transmission of pathogens. It is important to implement effective cleaning for the safe hospital environment. We conducted a three-phase study using human factors engineering (HFE) approach to enhance environmental cleanliness. METHODS: This study was conducted using a prospective interventional trial, and 28 (33.3%) of 84 wards in a medical center were sampled. The three-phases included pre-intervention analysis (Phase 1), implementing interventions by HFE principles (Phase 2), and programmatic analysis (Phase 3). The evaluations of terminal cleaning and disinfection were performed using the fluorescent marker, the adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence assay, and the aerobic colony count method simultaneously in all phases. Effective terminal cleaning and disinfection was qualified with the aggregate outcome of the same 10 high-touch surfaces per room. A score for each high-touch surface was recorded, with 0 denoting a fail and 10 denoting a pass by the benchmark of the evaluation method, and the total terminal cleaning and disinfection score (TCD score) was a score out of 100. RESULTS: In each phase, 840 high-touch surfaces were collected from 84 rooms after terminal cleaning and disinfection. After the interventions, the TCD score by the three evaluation methods all showed significant improved. The carriage incidence of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) decreased significantly from 4.1 per 1000 patient-days to 3.6 per 1000 patient-days (P = .03). CONCLUSION: The HFE approach can improve the thoroughness and the effectiveness of terminal cleaning and disinfection, and resulted in a reduction of patient carriage of MDRO at hospitals. Larger studies are necessary to establish whether such efforts of cleanliness can reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infection.',\n",
       " 'Diphtheria is an infectious disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The bacterium primarily infects the throat and upper airways and the produced diphtheria toxin (DT), which binds to the elongation factor 2 and blocks protein synthesis, can spread through the bloodstream and affect organs, such as the heart and kidneys. For more than 125 years, the therapy against diphtheria has been based on polyclonal horse sera directed against DT (diphtheria antitoxin; DAT). Animal sera have many disadvantages including serum sickness, batch-to-batch variation in quality and the use of animals for production. In this work, 400 human recombinant antibodies were generated against DT from two different phage display panning strategies using a human immune library. A panning in microtiter plates resulted in 22 unique in vitro neutralizing antibodies and a panning in solution combined with a functional neutralization screening resulted in 268 in vitro neutralizing antibodies. 61 unique antibodies were further characterized as scFv-Fc with 35 produced as fully human IgG1. The best in vitro neutralizing antibody showed an estimated relative potency of 454 IU/mg and minimal effective dose 50% (MED50%) of 3.0 pM at a constant amount of DT (4x minimal cytopathic dose) in the IgG format. The targeted domains of the 35 antibodies were analyzed by immunoblot and by epitope mapping using phage display. All three DT domains (enzymatic domain, translocation domain and receptor binding domain) are targets for neutralizing antibodies. When toxin neutralization assays were performed at higher toxin dose levels, the neutralizing capacity of individual antibodies was markedly reduced but this was largely compensated for by using two or more antibodies in combination, resulting in a potency of 79.4 IU/mg in the in vivo intradermal challenge assay. These recombinant antibody combinations are candidates for further clinical and regulatory development to replace equine DAT.',\n",
       " 'Streptococcus agalactiae is a causative agent of streptococcosis disease in various fish species, including Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus Linn.). Vaccination is an effective disease prevention and control method, but limitations remain for protecting against catastrophic mortality of fish infected with different strains of streptococci. Immunoproteomics analysis of S. agalactiae was used to identify antigenic proteins and construct a chimeric multiepitope vaccine. Epitopes from five antigenic proteins were shuffled in five helices of a flavodoxin backbone, and in silico analysis predicted a suitable RNA and protein structure for protein expression. 45F2 and 42E2 were identified as the best candidates for a chimeric multiepitope vaccine. Recombinant plasmids were constructed to produce a recombinant protein vaccine and DNA vaccine system. Overexpressed proteins were determined to be 30 kDa and 25 kDa in the E. coli and TK1 systems, respectively. The efficacy of the chimeric multiepitope construct as a recombinant protein vaccine and DNA vaccine was evaluated in Nile tilapia, followed by S. agalactiae challenge at 1 Ã\\x97 10(7) CFU/mL. Relative percentage survival (RPS) and cumulative mortality were recorded at approximately 57â\\x80\\x9376% and 17â\\x80\\x9330%, respectively. These chimeric multiepitope vaccines should be applied in streptococcosis disease control and developed into a multivalent vaccine to control multiple diseases.',\n",
       " 'Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a progressive arrhythmia with underlying mechanisms that are not fully elucidated, partially due to lack of reliable and affordable animal models. Here, we introduce a system for long-term assessment of AF susceptibility (substrate) in ambulatory rats implanted with miniature electrodes on the atrium. Rats were subjected to excessive aldosterone (Aldo) or solvent only (Sham). An additional group was exposed to myocardial infarction (MI). AF substrate was tested two- and four-weeks post implantation and was also compared with implanted rats early post-implantation (Base). Aldo and MI increased the AF substrate and atrial fibrosis. In the MI group only, AF duration was correlated with the level of atrial fibrosis and was inversely correlated with systolic function. Unexpectedly, Shams also developed progressive AF substrate relative to Base individuals. Further studies indicated that serum inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha) were not elevated in the shams. In addition, we excluded anxiety\\\\depression due to social-isolation as an AF promoting factor. Finally, enhanced biocompatibility of the atrial electrode did not inhibit the gradual development of AF substrate over a testing period of up to 8 weeks. Overall, we successfully validated the first system for long-term AF substrate testing in ambulatory rats.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients undergo extensive physiological alterations that will have impact on antibiotic pharmacokinetics. Up to 60% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients meet the pharmacodynamic targets of beta-lactam antibiotics, with only 30% in fluoroquinolones. Not reaching these targets might increase the chance of therapeutic failure, resulting in increased mortality and morbidity, and antibiotic resistance. The DOLPHIN trial was designed to demonstrate the added value of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of beta-lactam and fluoroquinolones in critically ill patients in the ICU. METHODS: A multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) was designed to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of model-based TDM of beta-lactam and fluoroquinolones. Four hundred fifty patients will be included within 24 months after start of inclusion. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to either study group: the intervention group (active TDM) or the control group (non-TDM). In the intervention group dose adjustment of the study antibiotics (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, flucloxacillin, piperacillin with tazobactam, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin) on day 1, 3, and 5 is performed based upon TDM with a Bayesian model. The primary outcome will be ICU length of stay. Other outcomes amongst all survival, disease severity, safety, quality of life after ICU discharge, and cost effectiveness will be included. DISCUSSION: No trial has investigated the effect of early TDM of beta-lactam and fluoroquinolones on clinical outcome in critically ill patients. The findings from the DOLPHIN trial will possibly lead to new insights in clinical management of critically ill patients receiving antibiotics. In short, to TDM or not to TDM?

       " 'BACKGROUND: The use of biomaterials has been expanded to improve the characteristics of vaccines. Recently we have identified that the peptide PH((1â\\x80\\x93110)) from polyhedrin self-aggregates and incorporates foreign proteins to form particles. We have proposed that this peptide can be used as an antigen carrying system for vaccines. However, the immune response generated by the antigen fused to the peptide has not been fully characterized. In addition, the adjuvant effect and thermostability of the particles has not been evaluated. RESULTS: In the present study we demonstrate the use of a system developed to generate nano and microparticles carrying as a fusion protein peptides or proteins of interest to be used as vaccines. These particles are purified easily by centrifugation. Immunization of animals with the particles in the absence of adjuvant result in a robust and long-lasting immune response. Proteins contained inside the particles are maintained for over 1 year at ambient temperature, preserving their immunological properties. CONCLUSION: The rapid and efficient production of the particles in addition to the robust immune response they generate position this system as an excellent method for the rapid response against emerging diseases. The thermostability conferred by the particle system facilitates the distribution of the vaccines in developing countries or areas with no electricity.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the gap between countriesâ\\x80\\x99 self-evaluation and external evaluation regarding core capacity of infectious disease control required by International Health Regulations and the influence factors of the gap. METHODS: We collected countriesâ\\x80\\x99 self-evaluated scores (International Health Regulations Monitoring tool, IHRMT) of 2016 and 2017, and external evaluation scores (Joint External Evaluation, JEE) from WHO website on 4rd and 27rd November, 2018. There were 127 and 163 countries with IHRMT scores in 2016 and in 2017, and 74 countries with JEE scores included in the analysis. The gap between countriesâ\\x80\\x99 self-evaluation and external evaluation was represented by the difference between condensed IHR scores and JEE. Civil liberties (CL) scores were collected as indicators of the transparency of each country. The Human Development Index (HDI) and data indicating the density of physicians and nurses (HWD) were collected to reflect countriesâ\\x80\\x99 development and health workforce statuses. Then, chi-square test and logistic regression were performed to determine the correlation between the gap of IHRMT and JEE, and civil liberties, human development, and health workforce status. RESULTS: Countriesâ\\x80\\x99 self-evaluation scores significantly decreased from 2016 to 2017. Countriesâ\\x80\\x99 external evaluation scores are consistently 1 to 1.5 lower than self-evaluation scores. There were significantly more countries with high HDI status, high CL status and high HWD status in groups with bigger gap between IHRMT and JEE. And countries with higher HDI status presented a higher risk of having bigger gap between countriesâ\\x80\\x99 self and external scores (OR = 3.181). CONCLUSION: Our study result indicated that countriesâ\\x80\\x99 transparency represented by CL status do play a role in the gap between IHR and JEE scores. But HDI status is the key factor which significantly associated with the gap. The main reason for the gap in the current world is the different interpretation of evaluation of high HDI countries, though low CL countries tended to over-scored their capacity.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: As patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) have long expected survival, the incidence of noncardiac surgery in this patient population is increasing. Here, we present the anesthetic management of a patient with a continuous-flow LVAD who underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old man with LVAD was scheduled to undergo VATS because of repeated spontaneous pneumothorax. Generally, patients with these devices have marginal right heart function; therefore, it is important to avoid factors that worsen pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). However, VATS requires one-lung ventilation (OLV) and it tends to cause increase in PVR, leading to right heart failure. In the present case, when the patient was set in a lateral decubitus position and progressive hypoxia was observed during OLV, transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated a dilated right ventricle and a temporally flattened interventricular septum, and the central venous pressure increased to approximately 20 mmHg. Because we anticipated deterioration of right heart function, dobutamine and milrinone were administered and/or respirator settings were changed to decrease PVR for maintaining LVAD performance. Finally, resection of a bulla was completed, and the patient was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day 37. CONCLUSIONS: The anesthetic management of a patient with LVAD during VATS is challenging because the possible hemodynamic changes induced by hypoxia associated with OLV affect LVAD performance and right heart function. In our experience, VATS that requires OLV will be well tolerated in a patient with LVAD with preserved right heart function, and a multidisciplinary approach to maintain right heart function will be needed.',\n",
       " 'The optimal way to treat severe thoracic scoliosis remains controversial. Compared with conventional procedures, the uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (UniVATS) rises in popularity in thoracic surgery because of less pain and faster recovery. This retrospective study aimed to apply UniVATS to treat severe thoracic scoliosis. Between October 2013 and March 2018, eight scoliotic patients with extremely large Cobb angle and profoundly limited flexibility underwent UniVATS for anterior release, followed by posterior instrumentation and fusion. The mean age at the time of surgery was 14.8 Â± 2.4 years and the mean follow-up was 2.2 Â± 1.3 years. The average levels of anterior thoracic discectomy and posterior fusion were 3.6 Â± 0.7 and 11.5 Â± 1.2, respectively. The mean coronal and sagittal correction rates were 70 Â± 19% and 71 Â± 23%, respectively. UniVATS contributed to minor access trauma (3-cm incision) with minimal blood loss, shorter operation time (75 Â± 13 mins), less requirement of stay in the intensive care unit (0.3 Â± 0.5 day) or chest tube placement (0.3 Â± 0.7 day), speedier and narcotic-free recovery, and earlier ambulation within one day. This is the first study to assess the safety and efficacy of UniVATS in the treatment of severely stiff thoracic scoliosis, providing comparable surgical outcomes, less pain, faster recovery and superior cosmetic results without significant complications.',\n",

While world health organization recommends HIV exposed infants to be tested between 4 to 6 weeks of age, in developing countries like Ethiopia, access to timely infant testing is still very limited. The study is intended to assess timely infant testing, testing for HIV at the 18th month, test results and factors influencing HIV positivity among infants born to HIV positive mothers in public hospitals of Mekelle, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was employed on 558 HIV exposed infants, using consecutive sampling technique. A checklist was used to extract 4 years (January 2014â\\x80\\x93December 2017) secondary data, collected from Januaryâ\\x80\\x93April 2018. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20, and binary logistic regression model was used to examine the association of independent variables with the outcome variables. RESULTS: Timely infant testing for HIV accounted for 346(62.0%). Mothers who attended antenatal care (AOR: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.17, 6.55) and who were counselled on feeding options (AOR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.11, 3.65) were strongly associated with timely infant testing.

Due to its non-selective receptor affinity arginineâ\\x80\\x93vasopressin also activates V2 (located on renal tubular cells of collecting ducts) and V1b (located in the anterior pituitary and in the pancreas) receptors, thereby potentially promoting undesired side effects such as anti-diuresis, procoagulant properties due to release of the von Willebrandâ\\x80\\x99s factor and platelet activation. Finally, it also cross-activates oxytocin receptors. During septic shock, vasopressin plasma levels were reported to be lower than expected, and a hypersensitivity to its vasopressor effect is reported in such situation. Terlipressin and selepressin are synthetic vasopressin analogues with a higher affinity for the V1 receptor, and, hence, potentially less side effects. In this narrative review, we present the current knowledge of the rationale, benefits and risks of vasopressin use in the setting of septic shock and vasoplegic shock following cardiac surgery. Clearly, vasopressin administration allows reducing norepinephrine requirements, but so far, no improvement of survival was reported and side effects are frequent, particularly ischaemic events. Finally, we will discuss the current indications for vasopressin and its agonists in the setting of septic shock, and the remaining unresolved questions.',\n",
       " 'Hypoxemic respiratory failure is usually accompanied with a certain extent of consolidation and alveolar derecruitment, which may still be present even after the patients have achieved the status of readiness to extubate. Functional residual capacity (FRC) is an indicator of lung aeration. This study aimed to evaluate whether pre-extubation FRC is associated with the risk of extubation failure in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. We prospectively included 92 patients intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. We used a technique based on a nitrogen multiple breath washout method to measure FRC before the planned extubation. The median FRC before extubation was 25 mL/kg (Interquartile range, 20â\\x80\\x9332 mL/Kg) per predicted body weight (pBW). After extubation, 20 patients (21.7%) were reintubated within 48 hours. The median FRC was higher in the extubation success group than in the extubation failure group (27 versus 21 mL/Kg, p < 0.001). Reduced FRC was associated with higher risk of extubation failure (odds ratio, 1.14 per each decreased of 1 mL/Kg of FRC/pBW, 95% CI, 1.05â\\x80\\x931.23, p = 0.002). In conclusion, pre-extubation FRC is associated with the risk of extubation failure. Reduced FRC may be incorporated into the traditional risk factors to identify patients at high risk for extubation failure.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Reproductive failure in sow herds due to infection with influenza A viruses has been described in the literature, but only a few studies have focused on the pathogenesis and the clinical signs of the infection. Case reports indicate an association between infections with influenza A viruses and reduced reproductive performance, although it has been difficult to experimentally reproduce the clinical outcome of poor reproductive performance. The aim of the present longitudinal field study was to compare the reproductive performance parameters before and after the implementation of vaccination against the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus in sow herds infected with pandemic influenza A virus. Therefore, farm-specific data of 137 sow herds in Germany, including 60,153 sows, as well as the clinical presentation of the infection were surveyed via questionnaire. Furthermore, average performance parameters (return to oestrus rate, abortion rate, stillbirth rate, number of piglets born alive per litter, preweaning mortality rate and number of piglets weaned per sow per year) were recorded for 6 months before vaccination and 6 months after completion of primary vaccination. RESULTS: In 79.8% of the farms, the clinical presentation of the infection was characterised by a reduced reproductive performance. These findings were confirmed by analysis of the performance parameters, which revealed a significant decline in the return to oestrus rate (p < 0.001), abortion rate (p < 0.001) and preweaning mortality rate (p = 0.023) and a significant increase of the number in piglets born alive (p = 0.001) and piglets weaned per sow per year (p < 0.001) after immunisation. The stillbirth rate did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: The present study represents the first attempt to demonstrate the association of influenza A virus infection, vaccination and the alteration in reproductive performance parameters, investigating a large number of cases. The results show that by vaccinating against the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, an improvement in reproductive performance can be achieved in sow herds infected with pandemic influenza A virus. Additionally, the large number of herds that were affected by poor reproductive performance after infection with the aforementioned virus confirms the assumption of an association between pandemic influenza A virus and reproductive losses.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that HCC patients and healthy subjects are equally responsive to a RNAdjuvant(Â®), a novel TLR-7/8/RIG-I agonist based on noncoding RNA developed by CureVac, by an ex vivo evaluation. However, the immunological effect of adjuvants on immune cells from cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy remains to be demonstrated. Different adjuvants currently used in cancer vaccine clinical trials were evaluated in the present study on immune cells from cancer patients before and after chemotherapy in an ex vivo setting. METHODS: PBMCs were obtained from 4 healthy volunteers and 23 patients affected by either colon (OMA) or lung cancer (OT). The effect of CpG, Poly I:C, Imiquimod and RNA-based adjuvant (RNAdjuvant(Â®)) was assessed using a multiparametric approach to analyze network dynamics of early immune responses. Evaluation of CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR expression as well as the downstream effect on CD4(+) T cell phenotyping was performed by flow cytometry; cytokine and chemokine production was evaluated by Bio-Plex ProTM. RESULTS: Treatment with RNAdjuvant(Â®) induced the strongest response in cancer patients in terms of activation of innate and adoptive immunity. Indeed, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR expression was found upregulated in circulating dendritic cells, which promoted a CD4(+) T cell differentiation towards an effector phenotype. RNAdjuvant(Â®) was the only one to induce most of the cytokines/chemokines tested with a pronounced Th1 cytokine pattern. According to the different parameters evaluated in the study, no clear cut difference in immune response to adjuvants was observed between healthy subjects and cancer patients. Moreover, in the latter group, the chemotherapy treatment did not consistently correlate to a significant altered response in the different parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first analysis of immunological effects induced by adjuvants in cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy, who are enrolled in the currently ongoing cancer vaccine clinical trials. The results show that the RNAdjuvant(Â®) is a potent and Th1 driving adjuvant, compared to those tested in the present study. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that chemotherapy does not significantly impair the immune system, implying that cancer patients are likely to respond to a cancer vaccine even after a chemotherapy treatment.',\n",
       " 'Schistosomiasis causes significant levels of morbidity and mortality in many geographical regions of the world. The disease is caused by infections with parasitic blood flukes known as schistosomes. The control of schistosomiasis over the last several decades has been centered on the mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel (PZQ), which is the only drug currently available for treatment. Despite the concerted efforts of MDA programs, the prevalence and transmission of schistosomiasis has remained largely unchecked due to the fact that PZQ is ineffective against juvenile schistosomes, does not prevent re-infection and the emergence of PZQ-resistant parasites. In addition, other measures such as the water, sanitation and hygiene programs and snail intermediate hosts control have had little to no impact. These drawbacks indicate that the current control strategies are severely inadequate at interrupting transmission and therefore, implementation of other control strategies are required. Ideally, an efficient vaccine is what is needed for long term protection thereby eliminating the current efforts of repeated mass drug administration. However, the general consensus in the field is that the integration of a viable vaccine with MDA and other control measures offer the best chance of achieving the goal of schistosomiasis elimination. This review focuses on the present status of schistosomiasis vaccine candidates in different phases of human clinical trials and provide some insight into future vaccine discovery and design.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Postoperative hypoxemia in acute type A aortic dissection (AADA) is a common complication and is associated with negative outcomes. This study aimed to analyze the efficacy of low-dose (5â\\x80\\x9310 ppm) inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in the management of hypoxemia after AADA surgery. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, Medical records of patients who underwent AADA surgery at two institutions between January 2015 and January 2018 were collected. Patients with postoperative hypoxemia were classified as iNO and control groups. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared using a propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis. RESULTS: Among 436 patients who underwent surgical repair, 187 (42.9%) had hypoxemia and 43 were treated with low-dose iNO. After PSM, patients were included in the iNO treatment (n = 40) and PSM control (n = 94) groups in a 1:3 ratio. iNO ameliorated hypoxemia at 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after initiation, and shortened the durations of ventilator support (39.0 h (31.3â\\x80\\x9347.8) vs. 69.0 h (47.8â\\x80\\x93110.3), p < 0.001) and ICU stay (122.0 h (80.8â\\x80\\x93155.0) vs 179.5 h (114.0â\\x80\\x93258.0), p < 0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in mortality, complications, or length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that low-dose iNO improved oxygenation in patients with hypoxemia after AADA surgery and shortened the durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. No significant side effects or increase in postoperative mortality or morbidities were observed with iNO treatment. These findings warrant a randomized multicenter controlled trial to assess the exact efficiency of iNO for hypoxemia after AADA.',\n",
       " 'Yersinia pestis, the cause of plague, could be weaponized. Unfortunately, development of new vaccines is limited by lack of correlates of protection. We used pre- and post-vaccination sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a flagellin adjuvanted F1/V vaccine trial to evaluate for protective markers. Here, we report for the first time in humans that inverse caspase-3 levels, which are measures of protective antibody, significantly increased by 29% and 75% on days 14 and 28 post-second vaccination, respectively. In addition, there were significant increases in T-cell responses on day 28 post-second vaccination. The strongest positive and negative correlations between protective antibody levels and gene expression signatures were identified for IFNG and ENSG00000225107 genes, respectively. Flagellin/F1/V subunit vaccine induced macrophage-protective antibody and significant CD4(+) T-cell responses. Several genes associated with these responses were identified that could serve as potential correlates of protection.',\n",

High-systemic toxicity and emergence of antifungal-resistant species warrant the development of newer preventive approaches against IC. Here, we have adopted an immunotherapeutic peptide vaccine-based approach, to enhance the bodyâ\\x80\\x99s immune response against invasive candida infections. Using computational tools, we screened the entire candida proteome (6030 proteins) and identified the most immunodominant HLA class I, HLA class II and B- cell epitopes. By further immunoinformatic analyses for enhanced vaccine efficacy, we selected the 18- most promising epitopes, which were joined together using molecular linkers to create a multivalent recombinant protein against Candida albicans (mvPC). To increase mvPCâ\\x80\\x99s immunogenicity, we added a synthetic adjuvant (RS09) to the mvPC design. The selected mvPC epitopes are homologous against all currently available annotated reference sequences of 22 C. albicans strains, thus offering a higher coverage and greater protective response. A major advantage of the current vaccine approach is mvPCâ\\x80\\x99s multivalent nature (recognizing multiple-epitopes), which is likely to provide enhanced protection against complex candida antigens. Here, we describe the computational analyses leading to mvPC design.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Influenza reassortment, a mechanism where influenza viruses exchange their RNA segments by co-infecting a single cell, has been implicated in several major pandemics since 19th century. Owing to the significant impact on public health and social stability, great attention has been received on the identification of influenza reassortment. METHODS: We proposed a novel computational method named HopPER (Host-prediction-based Probability Estimation of Reassortment), that sturdily estimates reassortment probabilities through host tropism prediction using 147 new features generated from seven physicochemical properties of amino acids. We conducted the experiments on a range of real and synthetic datasets and compared HopPER with several state-of-the-art methods. RESULTS: It is shown that 280 out of 318 candidate reassortants have been successfully identified. Additionally, not only can HopPER be applied to complete genomes but its effectiveness on incomplete genomes is also demonstrated. The analysis of evolutionary success of avian, human and swine viruses generated through reassortment across different years using HopPER further revealed the reassortment history of the influenza viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents a novel method for the prediction of influenza reassortment. We hope this method could facilitate rapid reassortment detection and provide novel insights into the evolutionary patterns of influenza viruses.',\n",

TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs) are ubiquitous outer membrane Î²-barrel proteins; they play an important role in the recognition of siderophores during iron uptake. Here, in the APEC strain DE205B, we investigated the role of four putative TBDRsâ\\x80\\x94ireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235â\\x80\\x94in iron uptake. Glutathione-S-transferase pulldown assays indicated that the proteins encoded by these genes directly interact with TonB. Moreover, the expression levels of all four genes were significantly upregulated under iron-depleted conditions compared with iron-rich conditions. The expression levels of several iron uptake-related genes were significantly increased in the ireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235 deletion strains, with the upregulation being the most prominent in the ireA deletion mutant. Furthermore, iron uptake by the ireA deletion strain was significantly increased compared to that by the wild-type strain. Moreover, a tonB mutant strain was constructed to study the effect of tonB deletion on the TBDRs. We found that regardless of the presence of tonB, the expression levels of the genes encoding the four TBDRs were regulated by fur. In conclusion, our findings indicated that ireA, 0007, 0008, and 2235 indeed encode TBDRs, with ireA having the most important role in iron uptake. These results should help future studies explore the mechanisms underlying the TonB-dependent iron uptake pathway.',\n",
       " 'Measuring antimalarial antibodies can estimate transmission in a population. To compare outputs, standardized laboratory testing is required. Here we describe the in-country establishment and quality control (QC) of a multiplex bead assay (MBA) for three sero-surveys in Haiti. Total IgG data against 21 antigens were collected for 32,758 participants. Titration curves of hyperimmune sera were included on assay plates, assay signals underwent 5-parameter regression, and inspection of the median and interquartile range (IQR) for the y-inflection point was used to determine assay precision. The medians and IQRs were similar for Surveys 1 and 2 for most antigens, while the IQRs increased for some antigens in Survey 3. Levey-Jennings charts for selected antigens provided a pass/fail criterion for each assay plate and, of 387 assay plates, 13 (3.4%) were repeated. Individual samples failed if IgG binding to the generic glutathione-S-transferase protein was observed, with 659 (2.0%) samples failing. An additional 455 (1.4%) observations failed due to low bead numbers (<20/analyte). The final dataset included 609,438 anti-malaria IgG data points from 32,099 participants; 96.6% of all potential data points if no QC failures had occurred. The MBA can be deployed with high-throughput data collection and low inter-plate variability while ensuring data quality.',\n",
       " 'The humanization of animal model immune systems by genetic engineering has shown great promise for antibody discovery, tolerance studies and for the evaluation of vaccines. Assessment of the baseline antibody repertoires of unimmunized model animals will be useful as a benchmark for future immunization experiments. We characterized the heavy chain and kappa light chain antibody repertoires of a model animal, the OmniRat, by high throughput antibody sequencing and made use of two novel datasets for comparison to human repertoires. Intra-animal and inter-animal repertoire comparisons reveal a high level of conservation in antibody diversity between the lymph node and spleen and between members of the species. Multiple differences were found in both the heavy and kappa chain repertoires between OmniRats and humans including gene segment usage, CDR3 length distributions, class switch recombination, somatic hypermutation levels and in features of V(D)J recombination. The Inference and Generation of Repertoires (IGoR) software tool was used to model recombination in VH regions which allowed for the quantification of some of these differences. Diversity estimates of the OmniRat heavy chain repertoires almost reached that of humans, around two orders of magnitude less. Despite variation between the species repertoires, a high frequency of OmniRat clonotypes were also found in the human repertoire. These data give insights into the development and selection of humanized animal antibodies and provide actionable information for use in vaccine studies.',\n",
       " 'Obesity is a multifaceted pathophysiological condition that has been associated with lipid accumulation, adipocyte dysfunction, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and an altered metabolic profile. Redox imbalance and excessive release of inflammatory mediators have been intricately linked in obesity-associated phenotypes. Hence, understanding the mechanisms of redox signaling pathways and molecular targets exacerbating oxidative stress is crucial in improving health outcomes. The activation of Na/K-ATPase/Src signaling, and its downstream pathways, by reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been recently implicated in obesity and subsequent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which causes further production of ROS creating an oxidant amplification loop. Apart from that, numerous studies have also characterized antioxidant properties of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), which is suppressed in an obese state. The induction of HO-1 restores cellular redox processes, which contributes to inhibition of the toxic milieu. The novelty of these independent mechanisms presents a unique opportunity to unravel their potential as molecular targets for redox regulation in obesity and NASH. The attenuation of oxidative stress, by understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms and associated mediators, with a targeted treatment modality may provide for improved therapeutic options to combat clinical disorders.',\n",
       " 'In late 2012 it was evidenced that most of the human genome is transcribed but only a small percentage of the transcripts are translated. This observation supported the importance of non-coding RNAs and it was confirmed in several organisms. The most abundant non-translated transcripts are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). In contrast to protein-coding RNAs, they show a more cell-specific expression. To understand the function of lncRNAs, it is fundamental to investigate in which cells they are preferentially expressed and to detect their subcellular localization. Recent improvements of techniques that localize single RNA molecules in tissues like single-cell RNA sequencing and fluorescence amplification methods have given a considerable boost in the knowledge of the lncRNA functions. In recent years, single-cell transcription variability was associated with non-coding RNA expression, revealing this class of RNAs as important transcripts in the cell lineage specification. The purpose of this review is to collect updated information about lncRNA classification and new findings on their function derived from single-cell analysis. We also retained useful for all researchers to describe the methods available for single-cell analysis and the databases collecting single-cell and lncRNA data.

       " 'We propose an automatic method to identify people who are potentially-infected by droplet-transmitted diseases. This high-risk group of infection was previously identified by conducting large-scale visits/interviews, or manually screening among tons of recorded surveillance videos. Both are time-intensive and most likely to delay the control of communicable diseases like influenza. In this paper, we address this challenge by solving a multi-tasking problem from the captured surveillance videos. This multi-tasking framework aims to model the principle of Close Proximity Interaction and thus infer the infection risk of individuals. The complete workflow includes three essential sub-tasks: (1) person re-identification (REID), to identify the diagnosed patient and infected individuals across different cameras, (2) depth estimation, to provide a spatial knowledge of the captured environment, (3) pose estimation, to evaluate the distance between the diagnosed and potentially-infected subjects. Our method significantly reduces the time and labor costs. We demonstrate the advantages of high accuracy and efficiency of our method. Our method is expected to be effective in accelerating the process of identifying the potentially infected group and ultimately contribute to the well-being of public health.',\n",

In this study, mouse pulmonary stem/progenitor cells (mPSCs) with capability to differentiate into type I or type II alveolar cells were used as an in vitro cell model to characterize replication and pathogenic effects of influenza viruses in PSCs. First, mPSCs and its immortalized cell line mPSCs(Oct4+) were shown to be susceptible to PR8, seasonal H1N1, 2009 pandemic H1N1, and H7N9 influenza viruses and can generate infectious virus particles, although with a lower virus titer, which could be attributed by the reduced vRNA replication and nucleoprotein (NP) aggregation in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, a significant increase of interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon (IFN)-Î³ at 12 h and IFN-Î² at 24 h post infection in mPSCs implicates that mPSCs might function as a sensor to modulate immune responses to influenza virus infection. In summary, our results demonstrated mPSCs, as one of the target cells for influenza A viruses, could modulate early proinflammatory responses to influenza virus infection.',\n",

It exhibits measurable levels of cytotoxicity, with 50% cytotoxic concentration values ranging from 7.5 Î¼M in CEM cells and up to >100 Î¼M in other cell lines. The mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POLRMT) has been shown to incorporate some nucleotide analogs into mitochondrial RNAs, resulting in substantial mitochondrial toxicity. NHC was tested in multiple assays intended to determine its potential to cause mitochondrial toxicity. NHC showed similar cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells incubated in a glucose-free and glucose-containing media, suggesting that NHC does not impair mitochondrial function in this cell line based on the Crabtree effect. We demonstrate that the 5â\\x80²-triphosphate of NHC can be used by POLRMT for incorporation into nascent RNA chain but does not cause immediate chain termination. In PC-3 cells treated with NHC, the 50% inhibitory concentrations of mitochondrial protein expression inhibition were 2.7-fold lower than those for nuclear-encoded protein expression, but this effect did not result in selective mitochondrial toxicity. A 14-day incubation of HepG2 cells with NHC had no effect on mitochondrial DNA copy number or extracellular lactate levels. In CEM cells treated with NHC at 10 Î¼M, a slight decrease (by â\\x88¼20%) in mitochondrial DNA copy number and a corresponding slight increase in extracellular lactate levels were detected, but these effects were not enhanced by an increase in NHC treatment concentration. In summary, the results indicate that mitochondrial impairment by NHC is not the main contributor to the compoundâ\\x80\\x99s observed cytotoxicity in these cell lines.',\n",
       " 'RATIONALE: There remains significant controversy regarding the optimal approach to fluid resuscitation for patients in shock. The magnitude of care variability in shock resuscitation, the confounding effects of disease severity and comorbidity, and the relative impact on sepsis survival are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate usual care variability and determine the differential effect of observed and predicted fluid resuscitation volumes on risk-adjusted hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients in shock. METHODS: We performed a retrospective outcome analysis of mechanically ventilated patients admitted to intensive care units using the 2013 Premier Hospital Database (Premier, Inc.). Observed and predicted hospital mortality were evaluated by observed and predicted day 1 fluid administration, using the difference in predicted and observed outcomes to adjust for disease severity between groups. Both predictive models were validated using a second large administrative database (Truven Health Analytics Inc.). Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU length of stay, and cost. RESULTS: Among 33,831 patients, observed hospital mortality was incrementally higher than predicted for each additional liter of day 1 fluid beginning at 7 L (40.9% vs. 37.2%, p = 0.008). Compared to patients that received expected (Â± 1.5 L predicted) day 1 fluid volumes, greater-than-expected fluid resuscitation was associated with increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality (52.3% vs. 45.0%, p < 0.0001) among all patients with shock and among a subgroup of shock patients with comorbid conditions predictive of lower fluid volume administration (47.1% vs. 41.5%, p < 0.0001). However, in patients with shock but without such conditions, both greater-than-expected (57.5% vs. 49.2%, p < 0.0001) and less-than-expected (52.1% vs. 49.2%, p = 0.037) day 1 fluid resuscitation were associated with increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Highly variable day 1 fluid resuscitation was associated with a non-uniform impact on risk-adjusted hospital mortality among distinct subgroups of mechanically ventilated patients with shock. These findings support closer evaluation of fluid resuscitation strategies that include broadly applied fluid volume targets in the early phase of shock resuscitation.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) has been proposed by medical guidelines for early severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) because of its survival benefits. However, new studies have provided evidence contradicting these results. METHOD: A search was performed of the Pubmed, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Virtual Health Library databases for randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating 28-day mortality in ARDS patients treated with NMBA within 48 h. An English language restriction was applied. Relevant data were extracted and pooled into risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effect model. Sensitivity and meta-regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: From 2675 studies, we included five RCTs in the analysis, for a total of 1461 patients with a mean PaO(2)/FIO(2) of 104 Â± 35 mmHg. The cisatracurium group had the same risk of death at 28 days (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78â\\x80\\x931.03; I(2) = 50%, p = 0.12) and 90 days (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62â\\x80\\x931.06; I(2) = 56%, p = 0.06) as the control group (no cisatracurium). The secondary outcomes of mechanical ventilation duration and ventilator-free days were not different between the two groups. Cisatracurium had a significantly lower risk of barotrauma than the control group with no difference in intensive care unit (ICU)â\\x80\\x93induced weakness. The PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio was higher in the cisatracurium group but not until 48 h. Meta-regression analysis of the baseline PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) revealed no heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis excluding the trial using high PEEP and light sedation strategy yielded an improvement in all mortality outcomes. CONCLUSION: NMBA improves oxygenation only after 48 h in moderate, severe ARDS patients and has a lower barotrauma risk without affecting ICU weakness. However, NMBA does not reduce ventilator-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation or, most importantly, the mortality risk regardless of the severity of ARDS.',\n",

Our work shows that the gallbladder is crucial for spread of P. aeruginosa from the bloodstream to the feces during bacteremia, a process that promotes transmission in this experimental system. Further research is needed to test to what extent these findings are relevant to infections in patients.',\n",

       " 'Peste des petits ruminants virus causes a highly contagious disease, which poses enormous economic losses in domestic animals and threatens the conservation of wild herbivores. Diagnosis remains a cornerstone to the Peste des petits ruminants Global Control and Eradication Strategy, an initiative of the World Organisation for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organisation. The present review presents the peste des petits ruminants diagnostic landscape, including the practicality of commercially available diagnostic tools, prototype tests and opportunities for new technologies. The most common peste des petits ruminants diagnostic tools include; agar gel immunodiffusion, counter-immunoelectrophoresis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction either gel-based or real-time, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification, reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assays, immunochromatographic lateral flow devices, luciferase immunoprecipitation system and pseudotype-based assays. These tests vary in their technical demands, but all require a laboratory with exception of immunochromatographic lateral flow and possibly reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification and reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assays. Thus, we are proposing an efficient integration of diagnostic tests for rapid and correct identification of peste des petits ruminants in endemic zones and to rapidly confirm outbreaks. Deployment of pen-side tests will improve diagnostic capacity in extremely remote settings and susceptible wildlife ecosystems, where transportation of clinical samples in the optimum cold chain is unreliable.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: No-touch environmental disinfection using ultraviolet devices has been highlighted in the past several years to control the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). However, its effectiveness in non-US healthcare settings is yet to be examined. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of disinfection by portable pulsed xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) devices in controlling transmission of MDROs in a non-US healthcare setting. METHODS: All patients admitted in the intensive care unit in a 629-bed tertiary referral hospital in Japan from August 2016 to February 2019 were enrolled. During the study period, PX-UV disinfection was added to manual terminal cleaning after every patient transfer/discharge. For microbiological evaluation, surfaces were selected for sampling by contact plates before/after manual cleaning and after PX-UV. After overnight incubation, colonies on the plates were counted. RESULTS: The incidence of newly acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) declined significantly (13.8 to 9.9 per 10,000 patient days, incidence rate ratio 0.71, p = 0.002), as well as that of newly acquired drug-resistant Acinetobacter (48.5 to 18.1, 0.37, p < 0.001). The percent reduction of the microbiological burden by manual cleaning was 81%, but a further 59% reduction was achieved by PX-UV. CONCLUSIONS: PX-UV is effective in further reducing the microbial burden and controlling MDROs in a non-US healthcare setting.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: In addition to outbreaks of nosocomial influenza, sporadic nosocomial influenza infections also occur but are generally not reported in the literature. This study aimed to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of cases of nosocomial influenza compared with the remaining severe cases of severe influenza in acute hospitals in Catalonia (Spain) which were identified by surveillance. METHODS: An observational case-case epidemiological study was carried out in patients aged â\\x89¥18 years from Catalan 12 hospitals between 2010 and 2016. For each laboratory-confirmed influenza case (nosocomial or not) we collected demographic, virological and clinical characteristics. We defined patients with nosocomial influenza as those admitted to a hospital for a reason other than acute respiratory infection in whom ILI symptoms developed â\\x89¥48 h after admission and influenza virus infection was confirmed using RT-PCR. Mixed-effects regression was used to estimate the crude and adjusted OR. RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred twenty-two hospitalized patients with severe laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection were included: 96 (5.6%) were classified as nosocomial influenza and more frequently had > 14 days of hospital stay (42.7% vs. 27.7%, P < .001) and higher mortality (18.8% vs. 12.6%, P < .02). The variables associated with nosocomial influenza cases in acute-care hospital settings were chronic renal disease (aOR 2.44 95% CI 1.44â\\x80\\x934.15) and immunodeficiency (aOR 1.79 95% CI 1.04â\\x80\\x933.06). CONCLUSIONS: Nosocomial infections are a recurring problem associated with high rates of chronic diseases and death. These findings underline the need for adherence to infection control guidelines.',\n",

       " 'Network properties govern the rate and extent of various spreading processes, from simple contagions to complex cascades. Recently, the analysis of spreading processes has been extended from static networks to temporal networks, where nodes and links appear and disappear. We focus on the effects of accessibility, whether there is a temporally consistent path from one node to another, and reachability, the density of the corresponding accessibility graph representation of the temporal network. The level of reachability thus inherently limits the possible extent of any spreading process on the temporal network. We study reachability in terms of the overall levels of temporal concurrency between edges and the structural cohesion of the network agglomerating over all edges. We use simulation results and develop heterogeneous mean-field model predictions for random networks to better quantify how the properties of the underlying temporal network regulate reachability.',\n",
       " 'Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) has become an increasingly serious public health problem and has complicated tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Levofloxacin (LOF) is an ideal anti-tuberculosis drug in clinical applications. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis in TB treatment have not been revealed. Our study performed transcriptome and methylome sequencing to investigate the potential biological characteristics of LOF resistance in M. tuberculosis H37Rv. In the transcriptome analysis, 953 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified; 514 and 439 DEGs were significantly downregulated and upregulated in the LOF-resistant group and control group, respectively. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 97 pathways were enriched in this study. In the methylome analysis, 239 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified; 150 and 89 DMGs were hypomethylated and hypermethylated in the LOF-resistant group and control group, respectively. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 74 pathways were enriched in this study. The overlap study suggested that 25 genes were obtained. It was notable that nine genes expressed downregulated mRNA and upregulated methylated levels, including pgi, fadE4, php, cyp132, pckA, rpmB1, pfkB, acg, and ctpF, especially cyp132, pckA, and pfkB, which were vital in LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The overlapping genes between transcriptome and methylome could be essential for studying the molecular mechanisms of LOF-resistant M. tuberculosis H37Rv. These results may provide informative evidence for TB treatment with LOF.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) cytomegaloviral (CMV) infection is common among patients with immunocompromised status; however, data specific to GI-CMV infection in immunocompetent patients are comparatively limited. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with GI-CMV infection at Siriraj Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand) during 2008â\\x80\\x932017. Baseline characteristics, presentations, comorbid conditions, endoscopic findings, treatments, and outcomes were compared between immunocompetent and immunocompromised. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-three patients (56 immunocompetent, 117 immunocompromised) were included. Immunocompetent patients were significantly older than immunocompromised patients (73 vs. 48.6 years, p < 0.0001). Significantly more immunocompetent patients were in the ICU at the time of diagnosis (21.0% vs. 8.6%, p = 0.024). GI bleeding was the leading presentation in immunocompetent, while diarrhea and abdominal pain were more common in immunocompromised. Blood CMV viral load was negative in significantly more immunocompetent than immunocompromised (40.7% vs. 12.9%, p = 0.002). Ganciclovir was the main treatment in both groups. Significantly more immunocompetent than immunocompromised did not receive any specific therapy (25.5% vs. 4.4%, p â\\x89¤ 0.01). Six-month mortality was significantly higher among immunocompetent patients (39.0% vs. 22.0%, p = 0.047). Independent predictors of death were old age and inpatient or ICU clinical setting. Treatment with antiviral agents was the only independent protective factor. CONCLUSION: GI-CMV infection was frequently observed among immunocompetent elderly patients with comorbidities or severe concomitant illnesses. GI bleeding was the most common presentation. Blood CMV viral load was not diagnostically helpful. Significantly higher mortality was observed in immunocompetent than in immunocompromised patients, but this could be due to more severe concomitant illnesses in the immunocompetent group.',\n",
       " 'Intracellular vesicle fusion is mediated by soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) and Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins. It is generally accepted that membrane fusion occurs when the vesicle and target membranes are brought into close proximity by SNAREs and SM proteins. In this work, we demonstrate that, for fusion to occur, membrane bilayers must be destabilized by a conserved membrane-embedded motif located at the juxtamembrane region of the vesicle-anchored v-SNARE. Comprised of basic and hydrophobic residues, the juxtamembrane motif perturbs the lipid bilayer structure and promotes SNARE-SM-mediated membrane fusion. The juxtamembrane motif can be functionally substituted with an unrelated membrane-disrupting peptide in the membrane fusion reaction. These findings establish the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE as a membrane-destabilizing peptide. Requirement of membrane-destabilizing peptides is likely a common feature of biological membrane fusion.',\n",
       " 'In the past two decades there has been a significant expansion in the number of new therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are approved by regulators. The discovery of these new medicines has been driven primarily by new approaches in inflammatory diseases and oncology, especially in immuno-oncology. Other recent successes have included new antibodies for use in viral diseases, including HIV. The perception of very high costs associated with mAbs has led to the assumption that they play no role in prophylaxis for diseases of poverty. However, improvements in antibody-expression yields and manufacturing processes indicate this is a cost-effective option for providing protection from many types of infection that should be revisited. Recent technology developments also indicate that several months of protection could be achieved with a single dose. Moreover, new methods in B cell sorting now enable the systematic identification of high-quality antibodies from humanized mice, or patients. This Review discusses the potential for passive immunization against schistosomiasis, fungal infections, dengue, and other neglected diseases.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of acute undifferentiated febrile illness (AUFI) are common in Nepal, but the exact etiology or risk factors for them often go unrecognized. Diseases like influenza, enteric fever and rickettsial fevers account for majority of such outbreaks. Optimal diagnostic tests to inform treatment decisions are not available at the point-of-care. A proper epidemiological and clinical characterization of such outbreaks is important for appropriate treatment and control efforts. METHODS: An investigation was initiated as a response to increased presentation of patients at Patan Hospital from Chalnakhel locality in Dakchinkali municipality, Kathmandu with AUFI from June 10 to July 1, 2016. Focused group discussion with local inhabitants and the epidemiological curve of febrile patients at local primary health care centre confirmed the outbreak. The household-survey was conducted in the area with questionnaire administered on patients to characterize their illnesses and their medical records were reviewed. A different set of questionnaire was administered on the patients and controls to investigate the association with common risk factors. Water samples were collected and analyzed microbiologically. RESULTS: Eighty one patients from 137 households suffered from febrile illness within 6 weeks window before the investigation. All the 67 sampled patients with acute fever had a generalized illness without a discernible focus of infection. Only 38% of the patients had received a clinical diagnosis while the rest were treated empirically without a diagnosis. Three patients had blood culture confirmed enteric fever. Forty-two (63%) patients had been administered antibiotics, most commonly, ofloxacin, cefixime or azithromycin with a mean fever clearance time of 4 days. There was no definite association between several risk factors and fever. Fecal contamination was noted in tap water samples. CONCLUSION: Based on the pattern of illness, this outbreak was most likely a mixture of self-limiting viral infections and enteric fever. This study shows that even in the absence of a confirmed diagnosis, a detailed characterization of the illness at presentation and the recovery course can suggest the diagnosis and help in formulating appropriate recommendation for treatment and control.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus (IAV) continues to pose serious threats to public health. The current prophylaxis and therapeutic interventions for IAV requires frequent changes due to the continuous antigenic drift and antigenic shift of IAV. Emerging evidence indicates that the host microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in intricate host-pathogen interaction networks. Cellular miRNAs may directly target virus to inhibit its infection and be developed as potential anti-virus drugs. METHODS: In this study, we established a broad-spectrum anti-IAV miRNA screening method using miRanda software. The screened miRNAs were further verified by luciferase assay, viral protein expression assay and virus replication assay. RESULTS: Five cellular miRNAs (miR-188-3p, miR-345-5p, miR-3183, miR-15-3p and miR-769-3p), targeting 99.96, 95.31, 92.9, 94.58 and 97.24% of human IAV strains recorded in NCBI, respectively, were chosen for further experimental verification. Finally, we found that miR-188-3p downregulated PB2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels by directly targeted the predicted sites on PB2 and effectively inhibited the replication of IAV (H1N1, H5N6 and H7N9) in A549 cells. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report screening cellular miRNAs that broad-spectrum inhibiting IAV infection. These findings suggested that cellular miR-188-3p could be used for RNAi-mediated anti-IAV therapeutic strategies.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are major causes of nosocomial infections globally. They are the current World Health Organization critical priority pathogens for resistance, Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance and discovery of new antibiotics. However, there is paucity of data on nosocomial infections (NIs) caused by such superbugs in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study determined the magnitude and profile of nosocomial MDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa infections among patients hospitalized at Felegehiwot referral hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Felegehiwot referral hospital from April 1 to July 31, 2018. A total of 238 patients with blood stream, urinary tract and surgical site NIs were enrolled conveniently. Either blood, urine and wound swab specimens were collected and processed using standard bacteriological procedures. A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates were identified using standard bacteriological techniques and confirmed by automated Vitek2 Compact. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing on isolates was performed using the disk diffusion technique. The results were interpreted as per the standard zone sizes of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.Chi-square test was done to determine associations among variables. P value < 0.05 was considered statistical significant. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 29 years. Overall,20(8.4%) of patients had nosocomial MDR A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa infections. The proportion of nosocomial MDR blood stream, urinary tract and surgical site infections were 13(8.9%), 5(8.3%) and 2 (6.3%), respectively. Patients with NI had lower mean age (24.9 years) (P = 0.035). All isolates of NIs were from patients with intravenous catheterization. The frequency of NI was 9(3.8%) for MDR A. baumannii and 11(4.6%) for MDR P.aeruginosa. A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa isolates were 100% MDR. All isolates of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were 100% resistant to ampicillin and piperacillin.A. baumannii isolates were 33.3 and 44.5% resistance against meropenem and ciprofloxacin, respectively while P.aeruginosa isolates revealed 36.4 and 45.5% resistance against ciprofloxacin and meropenem, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Health care associated infections of MDR A.baumannii and P. aeruginosa are critical problems in the study area. Therefore, urgent focused interventions required to contain the spreading of MDR NIs. Treatment of NIs for patients on health care should be guided by antimicrobial susceptibility testing.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that prone positioning (PP) can increase PaO(2)/FiO(2) and reduce mortality in moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The aim of our study was to determine whether the early use of PP combined with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) can avoid the need for intubation in moderate to severe ARDS patients. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study was performed in two teaching hospitals. Non-intubated moderate to severe ARDS patients were included and were placed in PP with NIV or with HFNC. The efficacy in improving oxygenation with four support methodsâ\\x80\\x94HFNC, HFNC+PP, NIV, NIV+PPâ\\x80\\x94were evaluated by blood gas analysis. The primary outcome was the rate of intubation. RESULTS: Between January 2018 and April 2019, 20 ARDS patients were enrolled. The main causes of ARDS were pneumonia due to influenza (9 cases, 45%) and other viruses (2 cases, 10%). Ten cases were moderate ARDS and 10 cases were severe. Eleven patients avoided intubation (success group), and 9 patients were intubated (failure group). All 7 patients with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 100 mmHg on NIV required intubation. PaO(2)/FiO(2) in HFNC+PP were significantly higher in the success group than in the failure group (125 Â± 41 mmHg vs 119 Â± 19 mmHg, P = 0.043). PaO(2)/FiO(2) demonstrated an upward trend in patients with all four support strategies: HFNC < HFNC+PP â\\x89¤ NIV < NIV+PP. The average duration for PP was 2 h twice daily. CONCLUSIONS: Early application of PP with HFNC, especially in patients with moderate ARDS and baseline SpO(2) > 95%, may help avoid intubation. The PP was well tolerated, and the efficacy on PaO(2)/FiO(2) of the four support strategies was HFNC < HFNC+PP â\\x89¤ NIV < NIV+PP.

       " 'The significance of the integral membrane protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) in the ebolavirus entry process has been determined using various cell lines derived from humans, non-human primates and fruit bats. Fruit bats have long been purported as the potential reservoir host for ebolaviruses, however several studies provide evidence that Mops condylurus, an insectivorous microbat, is also an ebolavirus reservoir. NPC1 receptor expression in the context of ebolavirus replication in microbat cells remains unstudied. In order to study Ebola virus (EBOV) cellular entry and replication in M. condylurus, we derived primary and immortalized cell cultures from 12 different organs. The NPC1 receptor expression was characterized by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry comparing the expression levels of M. condylurus primary and immortalized cells, HeLa cells, human embryonic kidney cells and cells from a European microbat species. EBOV replication kinetics was studied for four representative cell cultures using qRT-PCR. The aim was to elucidate the suitability of primary and immortalized cells from different tissues for studying NPC1 receptor expression levels and their potential influence on EBOV replication. The NPC1 receptor expression level in M. condylurus primary cells differed depending on the organ they were derived from and was for most cell types significantly lower than in human cell lines. Immortalized cells showed for most cell types higher expression levels than their corresponding primary cells. Concluding from our infection experiments with EBOV we suggest a potential correlation between NPC1 receptor expression level and virus replication rate in vitro.',\n",
       " 'The Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) cysteine-rich protective antigen (PfCyRPA) has emerged as a promising blood-stage candidate antigen for inclusion into a broadly cross-reactive malaria vaccine. This highly conserved protein among various geographical strains plays a key role in the red blood cell invasion process by P. falciparum merozoites, and antibodies against PfCyRPA can efficiently prevent the entry of the malaria parasites into red blood cells. The aim of the present study was to develop a human-compatible formulation of the PfCyRPA vaccine candidate and confirming its activity in preclinical studies. Recombinant PfCyRPA expressed in HEK 293 cells was chemically coupled to phosphoethanolamine and then incorporated into the membrane of unadjuvanted influenza virosomes approved as antigen delivery system for humans. Laboratory animals were immunised with the virosome-based PfCyRPA vaccine to determine its immunogenic properties and in particular, its capacity to elicit parasite binding and growth-inhibitory antibodies. The vaccine elicited in mice and rabbits high titers of PfCyRPA-specific antibodies that bound to the blood-stage parasites. At a concentration of 10 mg/mL, purified total serum IgG from immunised rabbits inhibited parasite growth in vitro by about 80%. Furthermore, in a P. falciparum infection mouse model, passive transfer of 10 mg of purified total IgG from PfCyRPA vaccinated rabbits reduced the in vivo parasite load by 77%. Influenza virosomes thus represent a suitable antigen delivery system for the induction of protective antibodies against the recombinant PfCyRPA, designating it as a highly suitable component for inclusion into a multivalent and multi-stage virosomal malaria vaccine.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Compared to continuous vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN), inspiration synchronized VMN has shown increased inhaled dose during noninvasive ventilation; however, its use during aerosol delivery via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is still unknown. METHODS: An adult manikin was connected to a dual-chamber model lung, which was driven by a critical care ventilator to simulate spontaneous breathing. A HFNC system was utilized with temperature at 37 Â° C while gas flow at 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 L/min. Inspiration synchronized and continuous aerosol generation were compared at different positions (at the inlet of humidifier vs close to patient). One milliliter of albuterol (2.5 mg/mL) was used in each run (n = 3). Collection filter was placed at the trachea and was removed after each run. Drug was eluted from the filter and assayed with UV spectrophotometry (276 nm). RESULTS: When nebulizer was placed close to patient, inhaled dose was higher with inspiration synchronized than continuous aerosol generation at all gas flows (p = 0.05) except at 5 L/min. When placed at the inlet of humidifier, compared to continuous, inspiration synchronized aerosol generated higher inhaled dose with gas flow set below 50% of patient inspiratory flow [23.9 (20.6, 28.3)% vs 18.1 (16.7, 19.6)%, p < 0.001], but lower inhaled dose with gas flow set above 50% of patient inspiratory flow [3.5 (2.2, 9.3)% vs 9.9 (8.2, 16.4)%, p = 0.001]. Regardless of breathing pattern, continuous aerosol delivered greater inhaled dose with nebulizer placed at humidifier than close to patient at all gas flows except at 5 L/min. CONCLUSION: When the HFNC gas flow was set higher than 50% of patient inspiratory flow, no significant advantage was found in inspiration synchronized over continuous aerosol. However, inspiration synchronized aerosol generated 30% more inhaled dose than continuous with gas flow set below 50% of patient inspiratory flow, regardless of nebulizer placement. Continuous nebulizer needs to be placed at the inlet of humidifier.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) use was associated with greater mortality in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Nevertheless, HFOV is still frequently used as rescue therapy in paediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS). In view of the limited evidence for HFOV in PARDS and evidence demonstrating harm in adult patients with ARDS, we hypothesized that HFOV use compared to other modes of mechanical ventilation is associated with increased mortality in PARDS. METHODS: Patients with PARDS from 10 paediatric intensive care units across Asia from 2009 to 2015 were identified. Data on epidemiology and clinical outcomes were collected. Patients on HFOV were compared to patients on other modes of ventilation. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality and secondary outcomes were 28-day ventilator- (VFD) and intensive care unit- (IFD) free days. Genetic matching (GM) method was used to analyse the association between HFOV treatment with the primary outcome. Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis, including propensity score (PS) matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and marginal structural modelling (MSM) to estimate the treatment effect. RESULTS: A total of 328 patients were included. In the first 7 days of PARDS, 122/328 (37.2%) patients were supported with HFOV. There were significant differences in baseline oxygenation index (OI) between the HFOV and non-HFOV groups (18.8 [12.0, 30.2] vs. 7.7 [5.1, 13.1] respectively; p < 0.001). A total of 118 pairs were matched in the GM method which found a significant association between HFOV with 28-day mortality in PARDS [odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 4.4, p value 0.01]. VFD was indifferent between the HFOV and non-HFOV group [mean difference â\\x88\\x92 1.3 (95%CI â\\x88\\x92 3.4, 0.9); p = 0.29] but IFD was significantly lower in the HFOV group [â\\x88\\x92 2.5 (95%CI â\\x88\\x92 4.9, â\\x88\\x92 0.5); p = 0.03]. From the sensitivity analysis, PS matching, IPTW and MSM all showed consistent direction of HFOV treatment effect in PARDS. CONCLUSION: The use of HFOV was associated with increased 28-day mortality in PARDS. This study suggests caution but does not eliminate equivocality and a randomized controlled trial is justified to examine the true association.

       " 'ACE2 is a monocarboxypeptidase which generates Angiotensin (1â\\x80\\x937) from Angiotensin II (1â\\x80\\x938). Attempts to target the kidney Renin Angiotensin System using native ACE2 to treat kidney disease are hampered by its large molecular size, 100 kDa, which precludes its glomerular filtration and subsequent tubular uptake. Here, we show that both urine and kidney lysates are capable of digesting native ACE2 into shorter proteins of ~60â\\x80\\x9375 kDa and then demonstrate that they are enzymatically very active. We then truncated the native ACE2 by design from the C-terminus to generate two short recombinant (r)ACE2 variants (1-605 and 1-619AA). These two truncates have a molecular size of ~70 kDa, as expected from the amino acid sequence and as shown by Western blot. ACE2 enzyme activity, measured using a specific substrate, was higher than that of the native rACE2 (1-740 AA). When infused to mice with genetic ACE2 deficiency, a single i.v. injection of 1-619 resulted in detectable ACE2 activity in urine, whereas infusion of the native ACE2 did not. Moreover, ACE2 activity was recovered in harvested kidneys from ACE2-deficient mice infused with 1-619, but not in controls (23.1 Â± 4.3 RFU/Âµg creatinine/h and 1.96 Â± 0.73 RFU/Âµg protein/hr, respectively). In addition, the kidneys of ACE2-null mice infused with 1-619 studied ex vivo formed more Ang (1â\\x80\\x937) from exogenous Ang II than those infused with vehicle (AUC 8555 Â± 1933 vs. 3439 Â± 753 ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.05) further demonstrating the functional effect of increasing kidney ACE2 activity after the infusion of our short ACE2 1-619 variant. We conclude that our novel short recombinant ACE2 variants undergo glomerular filtration, which is associated with kidney uptake of enzymatically active proteins that can enhance the formation of Ang (1â\\x80\\x937) from Ang II. These small ACE2 variants may offer a potentially useful approach to target kidney RAS overactivity to combat kidney injury.',\n",
       " 'Hepatitis E is an enteric disease highly prevalent in the developing countries. The basis for high mortality among pregnant hepatitis E patients remains unclear. Importantly, a large proportion of infected pregnant women present with subclinical infection as well. In order to understand the possible mechanisms influencing clinical presentation of hepatitis E in pregnant women, we explored a system biology approach. For this, PBMCs from various categories were subjected to RNAseq analysis. These included non-pregnant (NPR, acute and convalescent phases) and pregnant (PR, 2(nd) and 3(rd) trimesters, acute phase and subclinical HEV infections) patients and corresponding healthy controls. The current study deals with immune response genes. In contrast to exclusive up-regulation of nonspecific, early immune response transcripts in the NPR patients, the PR patients exhibited broader and heightened expression of genes associated with innate as well as adaptive T and B cell responses. The study identified for the first time (1) inverse relationship of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes overexpression and (2) association of differential expression of S100 series genes with disease presentation. The data suggests possible involvement of TLR4 and NOD1 in pregnant patients and alpha defensins in all patient categories suggesting a role in protection. Induction of IFNÎ³ gene was not detected during the acute phase irrespective of pregnancy. Association of response to vitamin D, transcripts related to NK/NKT and regulatory T cells during subclinical infection are noteworthy. The data obtained here could be correlated with several studies reported earlier in hepatitis E patients suggesting utility of PBMCs as an alternate specimen. The extensive, informative data provided here for the first time should form basis for future studies that will help in understanding pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis E.',\n",

Median (IQR) optimal PEEP decreased from 14 (12â\\x80\\x9316) to 10 (8â\\x80\\x9314) cmH(2)O. Thirteen (62%) patients increased their static compliance by â\\x89¥ 3 mL/cmH(2)O after PP on ECMO. This subgroup had higher body mass index, more frequent viral pneumonia, shorter ECMO duration, and lower baseline VT(dorsal)/VT(global) ratio than patients with compliance â\\x89¤ 3 mL/cmH(2)O (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Although baseline tidal volume distribution on EIT may predict static compliance improvement after PP on ECMO, our results support physiological benefits of PP in all ECMO patients, by modifying lung mechanics and potentially reducing VILI. Further studies, including a randomizedâ\\x80\\x93controlled trial, are now warranted to confirm potential PP benefits during ECMO.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Both overfeeding and underfeeding of intensive care unit (ICU) patients are associated with worse outcomes. A reliable estimation of the energy expenditure (EE) of ICU patients may help to avoid these phenomena. Several factors that influence EE have been studied previously. However, the effect of neuromuscular blocking agents on EE, which conceptually would lower EE, has not been extensively investigated. METHODS: We studied a cohort of adult critically ill patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and treatment with continuous infusion of cisatracurium for at least 12 h. The study aimed to quantify the effect of cisatracurium infusion on EE (primary endpoint). EE was estimated based on ventilator-derived VCO(2) (EE in kcal/day = VCO(2) Ã\\x97 8.19). A subgroup analysis of septic and non-septic patients was performed. Furthermore, the effects of body temperature and sepsis on EE were evaluated. A secondary endpoint was hypercaloric feeding (> 110% of EE) after cisatracurium infusion. RESULTS: In total, 122 patients were included. Mean EE before cisatracurium infusion was 1974 kcal/day and 1888 kcal/day after cisatracurium infusion. Multivariable analysis showed a significantly lower EE after cisatracurium infusion (MD â\\x88\\x92 132.0 kcal (95% CI â\\x88\\x92 212.0 to â\\x88\\x92 52.0; p = 0.001) in all patients. This difference was statistically significant in both sepsis and non-sepsis patients (p = 0.036 and p = 0.011). Non-sepsis patients had lower EE than sepsis patients (MD â\\x88\\x92 120.6 kcal; 95% CI â\\x88\\x92 200.5 to â\\x88\\x92 40.8, p = 0.003). Body temperature and EE were positively correlated (Spearmanâ\\x80\\x99s rho = 0.486, p < 0.001). Hypercaloric feeding was observed in 7 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that continuous infusion of cisatracurium in mechanically ventilated ICU patients is associated with a significant reduction in EE, although the magnitude of the effect is small. Sepsis and higher body temperature are associated with increased EE. Cisatracurium infusion is associated with overfeeding in only a minority of patients and therefore, in most patients, no reductions in caloric prescription are necessary.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: As more and more diagnostic and interventional options are becoming available for use in pediatric patients, techniques of procedural sedation analgesia (PSA) are being administered in considerably growing numbers as well. AIMS: The objective of this research effort was to conduct the first countrywide survey on the status quo of sedation analgesia as delivered to children and adolescents in Germany. METHODS: We dispatched letters to all pediatric hospital settings in Germany (n = 305), including a questionnaire that had been developed with existing guidelines taken into account. Its items were designed to elucidate the current practice of PSA throughout these pediatric centers regarding (a) organizational structures and (b) standards of medication and staffing. RESULTS: A total of 138 centers returned the questionnaire, hence the response rate was 45.2%. Numerous centers had implemented adequate structures and staffing standards. Deficits were nevertheless identified, most notably in terms of on-location equipment and staff provided to deliver sedations. Essential items of equipment were not provided in up to 26.8% of centers. Adequate staffing was not provided in up to 44.2% of centers, depending on the diagnostic or interventional procedures for which the PSA was delivered. The most widely used sedative agents were midazolam, ketamine/esketamine, and propofol. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate care structures for the management of procedural sedation analgesia have been implemented by many pediatric centers in Germany. On the downside, these findings also reveal deficits that will take efforts to be eliminated.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The epidemiological control of malaria has been hampered by the appearance of parasite resistance to anti-malarial drugs and by the resistance of mosquito vectors to control measures. This has also been associated with weak transmission control, mostly due to poor control of asymptomatic patients associated with host-vector transmission. This highlights the importance of studying the parasiteâ\\x80\\x99s sexual forms (gametocytes) which are involved in this phase of the parasiteâ\\x80\\x99s life-cycle. Some African and Asian strains of Plasmodium falciparum have been fully characterized regarding sexual formsâ\\x80\\x99 production; however, few Latin-American strains have been so characterized. This study was aimed at characterizing the Colombian FCB2 strain as a gametocyte producer able to infect mosquitoes. METHODS: Gametocyte production was induced in in vitro cultured P. falciparum FCB2 and 3D7 strains. Pfap2g and Pfs25 gene expression was detected in FCB2 strain gametocyte culture by RT-PCR. Comparative analysis of gametocytes obtained from both strains was made (counts and morphological changes). In vitro zygote formation from FCB2 gametocytes was induced by incubating a gametocyte culture sample at 27 Â°C for 20 min. A controlled Anopheles albimanus infection was made using an artificial feed system with cultured FCB2 gametocytes (14â\\x80\\x9315 days old). Mosquito midgut dissection was then carried out for analyzing oocysts. RESULTS: The FCB2 strain expressed Pfap2g, Pfs16, Pfg27/25 and Pfs25 sexual differentiation-related genes after in vitro sexual differentiation induction, producing gametocytes that conserved the expected morphological features. The amount of FCB2 gametocytes produced was similar to that from the 3D7 strain. FCB2 gametocytes were differentiated into zygotes and ookinetes after an in vitro low-temperature stimulus and infected An. albimanus mosquitoes, developing to oocyst stage. CONCLUSIONS: Even with the history of long-term FCB2 strain in vitro culture maintenance, it has retained its sexual differentiation ability. The gametocytes produced here preserved these parasite formsâ\\x80\\x99 usual characteristics and An. albimanus infection capability, thus enabling its use as a tool for studying sexual form biology, An. albimanus infection comparative analysis and anti-malarial drug and vaccine development.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Haemonchus contortus (H. contortus) is one of the most important parasites that cause huge economic losses to small ruminant industry worldwide. Effective prognosis and treatment depend upon the early diagnosis of H. contortus infection. To date, no widely-approved methods for the identification of prepatent H. contortus infection are available to identify prepatent H. contortus infection properly. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic potential of recombinant cold shock H. contortus protein (rHc-CS) during early and late infections of H. contortus in goat. RESULTS: Purified rHc-CS exhibited a clear band, with a molecular weight about 38 kDa. H. contortus eggs were not detected by fecal egg count technique from feces collected at 0 to 14 days post infection (D.P.I). However, eggs were detected at 21, 28 and 35 D.P.I. Hence, results of immunoblotting assay showed specific anti rHc-CS antibody detection in all goat sera collected at early stage (14 D.P.I) and late stage (21â\\x80\\x93103 D.P.I) of H. contortus infection. Furthermore, no cross reactivity was observed against Trichinella spiralis, Fasciola hepatica and Toxoplasma gondii or uninfected goats. Among several evaluated rHc-CS indirect-ELISA format variables, favorable antigen coating concentration was found 0.28 Î¼g/well at 37 Â°C 1 h and overnight at 4 Â°C. Moreover, optimum dilution ratio of serum and rabbit anti-goat IgG was recorded as 1:100 and 1:4000, respectively. The best blocking buffer was 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) while the best time for blocking, serum incubation and TMB reaction were recorded as 60, 120 and 10 min, respectively. The cut-off value for positive and negative interpretation was determined as 0.352 (OD(450)). The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the rHc-CS, both were recorded as 100%. CONCLUSION: These results validated that rHc-CS is a potential immunodiagnostic antigen to detect the specific antibodies during early and late H. contortus infections in goat.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness following critical illness is the consequence of loss of muscle mass and alteration of muscle quality. It is associated with long-term disability. Ultrasonography is a reliable tool to quantify muscle mass, but studies that evaluate muscle quality at the critically ill bedside are lacking. Shear wave ultrasound elastography (SWE) provides spatial representation of soft tissue stiffness and measures of muscle quality. The reliability and reproducibility of SWE in critically ill patients has never been evaluated. METHODS: Two operators tested in healthy controls and in critically ill patients the intra- and inter-operator reliability of the SWE using transversal and longitudinal views of the diaphragm and limb muscles. Reliability was calculated using the intra-class correlation coefficient and a bootstrap sampling method assessed their consistency. RESULTS: We collected 560 images. Longitudinal views of the diaphragm (ICC 0.83 [0.50â\\x80\\x930.94]), the biceps brachii (ICC 0.88 [0.67â\\x80\\x930.96]) and the rectus femoris (ICC 0.76 [0.34â\\x80\\x930.91]) were the most reliable views in a training set of healthy controls. Intra-class correlation coefficient for inter-operator reproducibility and intra-operator reliability was above 0.9 for all muscles in a validation set of healthy controls. In critically ill patients, inter-operator reproducibility and intra-operator 1 and 2 reliability ICCs were respectively 0.92 [0.71â\\x80\\x930.98], 0.93 [0.82â\\x80\\x930.98] and 0.92 [0.81â\\x80\\x930.98] for the diaphragm; 0.96 [0.86â\\x80\\x930.99], 0.98 [0.94â\\x80\\x930.99] and 0.99 [0.96â\\x80\\x931] for the biceps brachii and 0.91 [0.51â\\x80\\x930.98], 0.97 [0.93â\\x80\\x930.99] and 0.99 [0.97â\\x80\\x931] for the rectus femoris. The probability to reach intra-class correlation coefficient greater than 0.8 in a 10,000 bootstrap sampling for inter-operator reproducibility was respectively 81%, 84% and 78% for the diaphragm, the biceps brachii and the rectus femoris respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SWE is a reliable technique to evaluate limb muscles and the diaphragm in both healthy controls and in critically ill patients.

This study aimed to exploratively develop a standardized preparedness system to use during unfolding threats of severe infectious diseases. METHODS: A qualitative three-step study among infectious disease prevention and control experts was performed. First, interviews (n = 5) were conducted to identify which factors trigger preparedness activities during an unfolding threat.

Second, these triggers informed the design of a phased preparedness system which was tested in a focus group discussion ( RESULTS: Four preparedness phases were identified: preparedness phase green is a situation without the presence of the infectious disease threat that requires centralized care, anywhere in the world. Phase yellow is an outbreak in the world with some likelihood of imported cases. Phase orange is a realistic chance of an unexpected case within the country, or unrest developing among population or staff; phase red is cases admitted to hospitals in the country, potentially causing a shortage of resources. Specific preparedness activities included infection prevention, diagnostics, patient care, staff, and communication. Consensus was reached on the need for the development of a preparedness system and national coordination during threats. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed a standardized system to support institutional preparedness during an increasing threat. Use of this system by both curative healthcare institutions and the (municipal) public health service, could help to effectively communicate and align preparedness activities during future threats of severe infectious diseases.',\n",

However, research examining this issue among older adults in residential care homes (RCHs) is scant. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the impact of mobile device use on the cognitive function and depressive symptoms of older adults living in RCHs. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). RESULTS: A total of 235 senior residents (aged 82.58 Â± 5.54) in four RCHs were surveyed. Users of mobile devices had a significantly higher total MoCA score (25.02 Â± 4.14) and a significantly lower GDS-15 score (3.28 Â± 2.74) than non-users (MoCA: 19.34 Â± 5.21, GDS-15: 4.69 Â± 2.90). Multivariate linear regression indicate that mobile device use is significantly associated with total MoCA score, six of the seven sub-scores (visuospatial abilities and execution functions, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation)(P < 0.05). Logistic regression showed that mobile device use was significantly associated with the level of depressive symptoms (OR = 0.458, 95%CI = 0.249â\\x80\\x930.845). CONCLUSIONS: Use of mobile devices has a significant association with the cognitive function and depressive symptoms of older adults living in RCHs, and thus should be encouraged as a measure to maintain and improve cognition and prevent depression.',\n",
       " 'Worldwide strategies between 2010 and 2017 aimed at controlling malarial parasites (mainly Plasmodium falciparum) led to a reduction of just 18% regarding disease incidence rates. Many biologically-derived anti-malarial vaccine candidates have been developed to date; this has involved using many experimental animals, an immense amount of work and the investment of millions of dollars. This review provides an overview of the current state and the main results of clinical trials for sporozoite-targeting vaccines (i.e. the parasite stage infecting the liver) carried out by research groups in areas having variable malaria transmission rates. However, none has led to promising results regarding the effective control of the disease, thereby making it necessary to complement such efforts at finding/introducing new vaccine candidates by adopting a multi-epitope, multi-stage approach, based on minimal subunits of the main sporozoite proteins involved in the invasion of the liver.',\n",

       " 'Despite all the research done on the first Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemics, it was only after the Brazilian epidemic that the Congenital Zika Syndrome was described. This was made possible due to the large number of babies born with microcephaly in the Northeast region (NE) in a narrow time. We hypothesize that the fivefold difference in the rate of microcephalic neonates between the NE and other regions is partially an effect of the population prior immunity against Dengue viruses (DENV), that cross-react with ZIKV. In this ecological study, we analysed the interaction between dengue fever epidemics from 2001 to 2014 and the 2015/2016 microcephaly epidemic in 400 microregions in Brazil using random-effects models under a Bayesian approach. The estimated effect of the time lag between the most recent large dengue epidemic (>400/100,000 inhabitants) and the microcephaly epidemic ranged from protection (up to 6 years prior) to an increased risk (from 7 to 12 years). This sustained window of protection, larger than described in previous longitudinal studies, is possibly an effect of herd immunity and of multiple exposures to DENV that could boost immunity.',\n",

We examined the influenza season 2017/18 in terms of hospitalisation and mortality in the Austrian paediatric population and put the results into perspective of the available data from the last 15 years. METHODS: Cases of influenza-associated hospitalisations and deaths for season 2017/18 in children below 18 years were retrospectively collected from 12 and 33 Austrian hospitals, respectively. Hospitalisation and mortality rates for the whole Austrian paediatric population were estimated, adjusting for the population in each catchment area. Two Austrian databases were queried for hospitalisations and deaths associated with influenza during 2002â\\x80\\x932016. Rough estimate of the vaccination coverage was calculated from a survey on 100 inpatients. RESULTS: Influenza-related paediatric hospitalisation rate in season 2017/18 was estimated as 128 (CI: 122â\\x80\\x93135) per 100,000 children, much higher than the national average of 40 per 100,000 over the years 2002â\\x80\\x932016. There were nine reported influenza-associated deaths among children, resulting in mortality rate of 0.67 (CI: 0.32â\\x80\\x931.21) per 100,000 children. CONCLUSIONS: Reported influenza-associated hospitalisations and fatalities demonstrate a high burden of influenza in the Austrian paediatric population corresponding with very low vaccination coverage.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Various transcription factors are involved in the process of mutually exclusive expression and clonal variation of the Plasmodium multigene (var) family. Recent studies revealed that a P. falciparum SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin (PfSWIB) might trigger stage-specific programmed cell death (PCD), and was not only crucial for the survival and development of parasite, but also had profound effects on the parasite by interacting with other unknown proteins. However, it remains unclear whether PfSIWB is involved in transcriptional regulation of this virulence gene and its functional properties. METHODS: A conditional knockdown system â\\x80\\x9cPfSWIB-FKBP-LIDâ\\x80\\x9d was introduced to the parasite clone 3D7, and an integrated parasite line â\\x80\\x9cPfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LIDâ\\x80\\x9d was obtained by drug cycling and clone screening. Growth curve analysis (GCA) was performed to investigate the growth and development of different parasite lines during 96 h in vitro culturing, by assessing parasitemia. Finally, we performed qPCR assays to detect var gene expression profiling in various comparison groups, as well as the mutually exclusive expression pattern of the var genes within a single 48 h life-cycle of P. falciparum in different parasite lines. In addition, RNA-seq was applied to analyze the var gene expression in different lines. RESULTS: GCA revealed that conditional knockdown of PfSWIB could interfere with the growth and development of P. falciparum. The parasitemia of PfSWIBâ\\x88\\x86 showed a significant decline at 96 h during in vitro culture compared with the PfSWIB and 3D7 lines (P < 0.0001). qPCR and RNA-seq analysis confirmed that depletion of PfSWIB not only silences upsA, upsC and partial upsB var genes, as well as removes the silencing of partial upsB var genes at the ring stage in PfSWIBâ\\x88\\x86 line, but also leads to aberrant expression of upsA and partial upsB/upsC var genes at the mature stage of P. falciparum, during a single 48-h life-cycle. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that PfSWIB was involved in the process of clonal variation in var gene expression, and crucial for the survival and development of Plasmodium parasite. These findings could provide better understanding of the mechanism and function of PfSWIB contributing to the pathogenesis in malaria parasites. [Image: see text]',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Obesity is a global epidemic, and it is widely known that increased Body mass index (BMI) is associated with alterations in respiratory mechanics. Bariatric surgery is established as an effective treatment for this condition. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of different ventilation strategies in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials aimed at evaluating ventilation strategies for obese patients was carried out. Primary outcomes: in-hospital mortality, adequacy of gas exchange, and respiration mechanics alterations. RESULTS: Fourteen clinical trials with 574 participants were included. When recruitment maneuvers (RM) vs Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were compared, RM resulted in better oxygenation p = 0.03 (MD 79.93), higher plateau pressure p < 0.00001 (MD 7.30), higher mean airway pressure p < 0.00001 (MD 6.61), and higher compliance p < 0.00001 (MD 21.00); when comparing RM + Zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) vs RM + PEEP 5 or 10 cmH2O, RM associated with PEEP led to better oxygenation p = 0.001 (MD 167.00); when comparing Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) 40 cmH2O + PEEP 10 cmH2O vs CPAP 40 cmH2O + PEEP 15 cmH2O, CPAP 40 + PEEP 15 achieved better gas exchange p = 0.003 (MD 36.00) and compliance p = 0.0003 (MD 3.00). CONCLUSION: There is some evidence that the alveolar recruitment maneuvers associated with PEEP lead to better oxygenation and higher compliance. There is no evidence of differences between pressure control ventilation (PCV) and Volume control ventilation (VCV).',\n",

Given the magnitude of the school-aged child population, a sizeable proportion of influenza virus transmission events are expected to occur within school settings. However, influenza virus activity in schools is not well-understood, likely due to our limited ability to accurately monitor for respiratory viruses without disrupting the school environment. In this study, we evaluated the use of a bioaerosol sampling method to noninvasively detect and quantify airborne influenza A virus (IAV) densities in a public elementary school. Air samples were collected from multiple locations in the school, two days per week, throughout an eight-week sampling period during influenza season. Real-time RT-PCR targeting the IAV M gene revealed detectable IAV on five occasions in densities ranging from 2.0 Ã\\x97 10(â\\x88\\x921) to 1.9 Ã\\x97 10(4). No significant differences in IAV densities were related to student presence/absence. The majority of IAV-associated particles were â\\x89¤4 Î¼m in diameter, and theoretical calculations indicate infectious thresholds after minutes of exposure.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs) represent a promising therapeutic strategy for ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Translational challenges include restoring hMSC efficacy following cryopreservation, developing effective xenogeneic-free (XF) hMSCs and establishing true therapeutic potential at a clinically relevant time point of administration. We wished to determine whether cytokine pre-activation of cryopreserved, bone marrow-derived XF-hMSCs would enhance their capacity to facilitate injury resolution following VILI and elucidate mechanisms of action. METHODS: Initially, in vitro studies examined the potential for the secretome from cytokine pre-activated XF-hMSCs to attenuate pulmonary epithelial injury induced by cyclic mechanical stretch. Later, anaesthetised rats underwent VILI and, 6 h following injury, were randomized to receive 1 Ã\\x97 10(7) XF-hMSC/kg that were (i) naive fresh, (ii) naive cryopreserved, (iii) cytokine pre-activated fresh or (iv) cytokine pre-activated cryopreserved, while control animals received (v) vehicle. The extent of injury resolution was measured at 24 h after injury. Finally, the role of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) in mediating the effect of pre-activated XF-hMSCs was determined in a pulmonary epithelial wound repair model. RESULTS: Pre-activation enhanced the capacity of the XF-hMSC secretome to decrease stretch-induced pulmonary epithelial inflammation and injury. Both pre-activated fresh and cryopreserved XF-hMSCs enhanced resolution of injury following VILI, restoring oxygenation, improving lung compliance, reducing lung leak and improving resolution of lung structural injury. Finally, the secretome of pre-activated XF-hMSCs enhanced epithelial wound repair, in part via a KGF-dependent mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine pre-activation enhanced the capacity of cryopreserved, XF-hMSCs to promote injury resolution following VILI, potentially via a KGF-dependent mechanism.',\n",

Therefore, the aims of our study were to evaluate the basal level of expression of pivotal genes in the innate immune response and cell cycle regulation, as well as to evaluate the ability of this cell line to respond to infectious or non-infectious stressors. As surmised in our working hypothesis, we demonstrated the constitutive expression of genes involved in the innate immune response and cell defense alike, including TLRs, Interleukins, Myd88, p65/NF-kB and p53. Moreover, we described the ability of this cell line to respond to LPS and cadmium (Cd2+) in terms of gene expression and cytokine release.

We also conducted 5 key informant interviews with clinicians, ethics committee members, and district health government officials. RESULTS: Stakeholders perceived HIS research to have potential population health benefits, but they also had concerns, particularly related to the safety of volunteers and negative community reactions. Acceptability depended on a range of conditions related to procedures for voluntary and informed consent, inclusion criteria, medical care or support, compensation, regulation, and robust community engagement. These conditions largely mirror those in existing guidelines for HIS and biomedical research in LMICs. Stakeholder perceptions pointed to potential tensions, for example, balancing equity, safety, and relevance in inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest HIS research could be acceptable in Malawi, provided certain conditions are in place. Ongoing assessment of participant experiences and stakeholder perceptions will be required to strengthen HIS research during development and roll-out.',\n",
       " 'The 2014â\\x80\\x932015 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5NX outbreak represents the largest and most expensive HPAI outbreak in the United States to date. Despite extensive traditional and molecular epidemiological studies, factors associated with the spread of HPAI among midwestern poultry premises remain unclear. To better understand the dynamics of this outbreak, 182 full genome HPAI H5N2 sequences isolated from commercial layer chicken and turkey production premises were analyzed using evolutionary models able to accommodate epidemiological and geographic information. Epidemiological compartmental models embedded in a phylogenetic framework provided evidence that poultry type acted as a barrier to the transmission of virus among midwestern poultry farms. Furthermore, after initial introduction, the propagation of HPAI cases was self-sustainable within the commercial poultry industries. Discrete trait diffusion models indicated that within state viral transitions occurred more frequently than inter-state transitions. Distance and sample size were very strongly supported as associated with viral transition between county groups (Bayes Factor > 30.0). Together these findings indicate that the different types of midwestern poultry industries were not a single homogenous population, but rather, the outbreak was shaped by poultry industries and geographic factors.',\n",
       " 'The purpose of this investigation was to identify the prevalence of hypoalbuminemia and obesity in orthopaedic trauma patients with high-energy injuries and to investigate their impact on the incidence of surgical site complications. Patients 18 years of age and older undergoing intramedullary nail fixation of their femoral shaft fractures at a university-based level-1 trauma centre were assessed. Malnutrition was measured using serum markers (albumin <3.5 g/dL) as well as body mass index (BMI) as a marker of obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m(2)). The primary outcome measure was surgical wound complications. A total of 249 patients were included in this study. Ninety-eight patients (39.4%) presented with hypoalbuminaemia and 80 patients (32.1%) were obese. The overall incidence of wound complications in our study population was 9.65% (n = 25/259). A logistic regression model showed that non-obese patients (BMI < 30 kg/m(2)) were at significantly reduced risk for perioperative wound complications (Odds Ratio 0.400 [95% confidence interval 0.168, 0.954], p = 0.039). This study demonstrated a substantial prevalence of hypoalbuminemia and obesity among orthopaedic trauma patients with high-energy injuries. Obesity may increase the risk of surgical site complications. Future studies are required to further define malnutrition and its correlation with surgical site complications in orthopaedic trauma patients.',\n",
       " 'Washington, DC continues to experience a generalized HIV-1 epidemic. We characterized the local phylodynamics of HIV-1 in DC using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Viral samples from 68 participants from 2016 through 2017 were sequenced and paired with epidemiological data. Phylogenetic and network inferences, drug resistant mutations (DRMs), subtypes and HIV-1 diversity estimations were completed. Haplotypes were reconstructed to infer transmission clusters. Phylodynamic inferences based on the HIV-1 polymerase (pol) and envelope genes (env) were compared. Higher HIV-1 diversity (n.s.) was seen in men who have sex with men, heterosexual, and male participants in DC. 54.0% of the participants contained at least one DRM. The 40â\\x80\\x9349 year-olds showed the highest prevalence of DRMs (22.9%). Phylogenetic analysis of pol and env sequences grouped 31.9â\\x80\\x9333.8% of the participants into clusters. HIV-TRACE grouped 2.9â\\x80\\x9312.8% of participants when using consensus sequences and 9.0â\\x80\\x9364.2% when using haplotypes. NGS allowed us to characterize the local phylodynamics of HIV-1 in DC more broadly and accurately, given a better representation of its diversity and dynamics. Reconstructed haplotypes provided novel and deeper phylodynamic insights, which led to networks linking a higher number of participants. Our understanding of the HIV-1 epidemic was expanded with the powerful coupling of HIV-1 NGS data with epidemiological data.',\n",
       " 'The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the major organelle in the cell for protein folding and plays an important role in cellular functions. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in response to misfolded or unfolded protein accumulation in the ER. However, the UPR successfully alleviates the ER stress. If UPR fails to restore ER homeostasis, apoptosis is induced. ER stress plays an important role in innate immune signaling in response to microorganisms. Dysregulation of UPR signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of a variety of infectious diseases. In this review, we summarize the contribution of ER stress to the innate immune response to invading microorganisms and its role in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases.',\n",
       " 'Since cancer stem cells (CSCs) were first identified in leukemia in 1994, they have been considered promising therapeutic targets for cancer therapy. These cells have self-renewal capacity and differentiation potential and contribute to multiple tumor malignancies, such as recurrence, metastasis, heterogeneity, multidrug resistance, and radiation resistance. The biological activities of CSCs are regulated by several pluripotent transcription factors, such as OCT4, Sox2, Nanog, KLF4, and MYC. In addition, many intracellular signaling pathways, such as Wnt, NF-ÎºB (nuclear factor-ÎºB), Notch, Hedgehog, JAK-STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription), PI3K/AKT/mTOR (phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin), TGF (transforming growth factor)/SMAD, and PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor), as well as extracellular factors, such as vascular niches, hypoxia, tumor-associated macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts, cancer-associated mesenchymal stem cells, extracellular matrix, and exosomes, have been shown to be very important regulators of CSCs. Molecules, vaccines, antibodies, and CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cell) cells have been developed to specifically target CSCs, and some of these factors are already undergoing clinical trials. This review summarizes the characterization and identification of CSCs, depicts major factors and pathways that regulate CSC development, and discusses potential targeted therapy for CSCs.',\n",
       " 'About 30% of patients with impaired cardiac function have ventricular dyssynchrony and seek cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). In this study, we demonstrate synchronized biventricular (BiV) pacing in a leadless fashion by implementing miniaturized and wirelessly powered pacemakers. With their flexible form factors, two pacemakers were implanted epicardially on the right and left ventricles of a porcine model and were inductively powered at 13.56 MHz and 40.68 MHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands, respectively. The power consumption of these pacemakers is reduced to ÂµW-level by a novel integrated circuit design, which considerably extends the maximum operating distance. Leadless BiV pacing is demonstrated for the first time in both open-chest and closed-chest porcine settings. The clinical outcomes associated with different interventricular delays are verified through electrophysiologic and hemodynamic responses. The closed-chest pacing only requires the external source power of 0.3 W and 0.8 W at 13.56 MHz and 40.68 MHz, respectively, which leads to specific absorption rates (SARs) 2â\\x80\\x933 orders of magnitude lower than the safety regulation limit. This work serves as a basis for future wirelessly powered leadless pacemakers that address various cardiac resynchronization challenges.',\n",
       " 'Human influenza A viruses are known to be transmitted via the air from person to person. It is unknown from which anatomical site of the respiratory tract influenza A virus transmission occurs. Here, pairs of genetically tagged and untagged influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and A/H5N1 viruses that are transmissible via the air are used to co-infect donor ferrets via the intranasal and intratracheal routes to cause an upper and lower respiratory tract infection, respectively. In all transmission cases, we observe that the viruses in the recipient ferrets are of the same genotype as the viruses inoculated intranasally, demonstrating that they are expelled from the upper respiratory tract of ferrets rather than from trachea or the lower airways. Moreover, influenza A viruses that are transmissible via the air preferentially infect ferret and human nasal respiratory epithelium. These results indicate that virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, the nasal respiratory epithelium in particular, of donors is a driver for transmission of influenza A viruses via the air.',\n",
       " 'Bacterial infections continue to threaten humankind and the rapid spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria is alarming. Current antibiotics target essential bacterial processes and thereby apply a strong selective pressure on pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria alike. One alternative strategy is to block bacterial virulence systems that are essential for the ability to cause disease but not for general bacterial viability. We have previously show that the plant natural product (-)-hopeaphenol blocks the type III secretion system (T3SS) in the Gram-negative pathogens Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. (-)-Hopeaphenol is a resveratrol tetramer and in the present study we explore various resveratrol dimers, including partial structures of (-)-hopeaphenol, as T3SS inhibitors. To allow rapid and efficient assessment of T3SS inhibition in P. aeruginosa, we developed a new screening method by using a green fluorescent protein reporter under the control of the ExoS promoter. Using a panel of assays we showed that compounds with a benzofuran core structure i.e. viniferifuran, dehydroampelopsin B, anigopreissin A, dehydro-Î´-viniferin and resveratrol-piceatannol hybrid displayed significant to moderate activities towards the T3SS in Y. pseudotuberculosis and P. aeruginosa.',\n",
       " 'The conserved hemagglutinin (HA) stem has been a focus of universal influenza vaccine efforts. Influenza A group 1 HA stem-nanoparticles have been demonstrated to confer heterosubtypic protection in animals; however, the protection does not extend to group 2 viruses, due in part to differences in glycosylation between group 1 and 2 stems. Here, we show that introducing the group 2 glycan at Asn38(HA1) to a group 1 stem-nanoparticle (gN38 variant) based on A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) broadens antibody responses to cross-react with group 2 HAs. Immunoglobulins elicited by the gN38 variant provide complete protection against group 2 H7N9 virus infection, while the variant loses protection against a group 1 H5N1 virus. The N38(HA1) glycan thus is pivotal in directing antibody responses by controlling access to group-determining stem epitopes. Precise targeting of stem-directed antibody responses to the site of vulnerability by glycan repositioning may be a step towards achieving cross-group influenza protection.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a significant cause of mortality in the intensive care unit. Early diagnosis of VAP is important to provide appropriate treatment and reduce mortality. Developing a noninvasive and highly accurate diagnostic method is important. The invention of electronic sensors has been applied to analyze the volatile organic compounds in breath to detect VAP using a machine learning technique. However, the process of building an algorithm is usually unclear and prevents physicians from applying the artificial intelligence technique in clinical practice. Clear processes of model building and assessing accuracy are warranted. The objective of this study was to develop a breath test for VAP with a standardized protocol for a machine learning technique. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study. This study enrolled subjects in an intensive care unit of a hospital in southern Taiwan from February 2017 to June 2019. We recruited patients with VAP as the case group and ventilated patients without pneumonia as the control group. We collected exhaled breath and analyzed the electric resistance changes of 32 sensor arrays of an electronic nose. We split the data into a set for training algorithms and a set for testing. We applied eight machine learning algorithms to build prediction models, improving model performance and providing an estimated diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 33 cases and 26 controls were used in the final analysis. Using eight machine learning algorithms, the mean accuracy in the testing set was 0.81 Â± 0.04, the sensitivity was 0.79 Â± 0.08, the specificity was 0.83 Â± 0.00, the positive predictive value was 0.85 Â± 0.02, the negative predictive value was 0.77 Â± 0.06, and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves was 0.85 Â± 0.04. The mean kappa value in the testing set was 0.62 Â± 0.08, which suggested good agreement. CONCLUSIONS: There was good accuracy in detecting VAP by sensor array and machine learning techniques. Artificial intelligence has the potential to assist the physician in making a clinical diagnosis. Clear protocols for data processing and the modeling procedure needed to increase generalizability.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Our recent meta-analysis indicated that vitamin C may shorten the length of ICU stay and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Here we analyze modification of the vitamin C effect on ventilation time, by the control group ventilation time (which we used as a proxy for severity of disease in the patients of each trial). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and reference lists of relevant publications. We included controlled trials in which the administration of vitamin C was the only difference between the study groups. We did not limit our search to randomized trials and did not require placebo control. We included all doses and all durations of vitamin C administration. One author extracted study characteristics and outcomes from the trial reports and entered the data in a spreadsheet. Both authors checked the data entered against the original reports. We used meta-regression to examine whether the vitamin C effect on ventilation time depends on the duration of ventilation in the control group. RESULTS: We identified nine potentially eligible trials, eight of which were included in the meta-analysis. We pooled the results of the eight trials, including 685 patients in total, and found that vitamin C shortened the length of mechanical ventilation on average by 14% (P = 0.00001). However, there was significant heterogeneity in the effect of vitamin C between the trials. Heterogeneity was fully explained by the ventilation time in the untreated control group. Vitamin C was most beneficial for patients with the longest ventilation, corresponding to the most severely ill patients. In five trials including 471 patients requiring ventilation for over 10 h, a dosage of 1â\\x80\\x936 g/day of vitamin C shortened ventilation time on average by 25% (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We found strong evidence that vitamin C shortens the duration of mechanical ventilation, but the magnitude of the effect seems to depend on the duration of ventilation in the untreated control group. The level of baseline illness severity should be considered in further research. Different doses should be compared directly in future trials.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Previous scoring models such as the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoring systems do not adequately predict mortality of patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for severe acute kidney injury. Accordingly, the present study applies machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy for this patient subset. METHODS: We randomly divided a total of 1571 adult patients who started CRRT for acute kidney injury into training (70%, n = 1094) and test (30%, n = 477) sets. The primary output consisted of the probability of mortality during admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or hospital. We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of several machine learning algorithms with that of the APACHE II, SOFA, and the new abbreviated mortality scoring system for acute kidney injury with CRRT (MOSAIC model) results. RESULTS: For the ICU mortality, the random forest model showed the highest AUC (0.784 [0.744â\\x80\\x930.825]), and the artificial neural network and extreme gradient boost models demonstrated the next best results (0.776 [0.735â\\x80\\x930.818]). The AUC of the random forest model was higher than 0.611 (0.583â\\x80\\x930.640), 0.677 (0.651â\\x80\\x930.703), and 0.722 (0.677â\\x80\\x930.767), as achieved by APACHE II, SOFA, and MOSAIC, respectively. The machine learning models also predicted in-hospital mortality better than APACHE II, SOFA, and MOSAIC. CONCLUSION: Machine learning algorithms increase the accuracy of mortality prediction for patients undergoing CRRT for acute kidney injury compared with previous scoring models.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: High glycemic variability (GV) is common in critically ill patients; however, the prevalence and mortality association with early GV in patients with sepsis remains unclear. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a medical intensive care unit (ICU) in central Taiwan. Patients in the ICU with sepsis between January 2014 and December 2015 were included for analysis. All of these patients received protocol-based management, including blood sugar monitoring every 2 h for the first 24 h of ICU admission. Mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) and coefficient of variation (CoV) were used to assess GV. RESULTS: A total of 452 patients (mean age 71.4 Â± 14.7 years; 76.7% men) were enrolled for analysis. They were divided into high GV (43.4%, 196/452) and low GV (56.6%, 256/512) groups using MAGE 65 mg/dL as the cut-off point. Patients with high GV tended to have higher HbA1c (6.7 Â± 1.8% vs. 5.9 Â± 0.9%, p < 0.01) and were more likely to have diabetes mellitus (DM) (50.0% vs. 23.4%, p < 0.01) compared with those in the low GV group. Kaplanâ\\x80\\x93Meier analysis showed that a high GV was associated with increased 30-day mortality (log-rank test, p = 0.018). The association remained strong in the non-DM (log-rank test, p = 0.035), but not in the DM (log-rank test, p = 0.254) group. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified that high APACHE II score (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.045, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.013â\\x80\\x931.078), high serum lactate level at 0 h (aHR 1.009, 95% CI 1.003â\\x80\\x931.014), having chronic airway disease (aHR 0.478, 95% CI 0.302â\\x80\\x930.756), high mean day 1 glucose (aHR 1.008, 95% CI 1.000â\\x80\\x931.016), and high MAGE (aHR 1.607, 95% CI 1.008â\\x80\\x932.563) were independently associated with increased 30-day mortality. The association with 30-day mortality remained consistent when using CoV to assess GV. CONCLUSIONS: We found that approximately 40% of the septic patients had a high early GV, defined as MAGE > 65 mg/dL. Higher GV within 24 h of ICU admission was independently associated with increased 30-day mortality. These findings highlight the need to monitor GV in septic patients early during an ICU admission.',\n",

       " 'The ability to preserve metabolically active livers ex vivo for 1 week or more could allow repair of poor-quality livers that would otherwise be declined for transplantation. Current approaches for normothermic perfusion can preserve human livers for only 24 h. Here we report a liver perfusion machine that integrates multiple core physiological functions, including automated management of glucose levels and oxygenation, waste-product removal and hematocrit control. We developed the machine in a stepwise fashion using pig livers. Study of multiple ex vivo parameters and early phase reperfusion in vivo demonstrated the viability of pig livers perfused for 1 week without the need for additional blood products or perfusate exchange. We tested the approach on ten injured human livers that had been declined for transplantation by all European centers.

During a genetically confirmed RSV outbreak, eight patients underwent both chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT). Among these, 5 cases had newly appearing abnormalities on CT, although chest X-ray was able to detect abnormalities in only 2 cases (40%). Although bronchial wall thickening was common, other findings and their distribution were variable, even in an outbreak setting. All patients with both a history of anticancer chemotherapy against hematological cancer and lower respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, sputum, and hypoxemia, had abnormalities on CT, suggesting that these two factors might be important for predicting the existence of LRTI in RSV-infected patients.',\n",
       " 'Pharyngitis is usually caused by a viral infection for which antibiotics are often unnecessarily prescribed, adding to the burden of antimicrobial resistance. Identifying who needs antibiotics is challenging; microbiological confirmation and clinical scores are used but have limitations. In a cross-sectional study nested within a randomized controlled trial, we estimated the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of group A Streptococcus (GAS) in patients presenting to primary care with a sore throat and fever in northern Thailand. We then evaluated the use of C-reactive protein (CRP) and clinical scores (Centor and FeverPAIN) to identify the presence of GAS. One hundred sixty-nine patients were enrolled, of whom 35 (20.7%) had Î²-hemolytic Streptococci (BHS) isolated from throat swab culture, and 11 (6.5%) had GAS. All GAS isolates were sensitive to penicillin G. The median CRP of those without BHS isolation was 10 mg/L (interquartile range [IQR] â\\x89¤ 8â\\x80\\x9318), compared with 18 mg/L (IQR 9â\\x80\\x9371, P = 0.0302) for those with GAS and 14 mg/L (IQR â\\x89¤ 8â\\x80\\x9338, P = 0.0516) for those with any BHS isolated. However, there were no significant relationships between CRP > 8 mg/L (P = 0.112), Centor â\\x89¥ 3 (P = 0.212), and FeverPAIN â\\x89¥ 4 (P = 1.000), and the diagnosis of GAS compared with no BHS isolation. Identifying who requires antibiotics for pharyngitis remains challenging and necessitates further larger studies. C-reactive protein testing alone, although imperfect, can reduce prescribing compared with routine care. Targeted CRP testing through clinical scoring may be the most cost-effective approach to ruling out GAS infection.',\n",
       " 'The activation of somatic mutations conferring sensitivity to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been widely used in the development of advanced or metastatic primary lung cancer therapy. Therefore, identification of EGFR mutations is essential. In the present study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was used to identify EGFR mutations, and its efficiency was compared with the Therascreen quantitative PCR assay. Using LAMP and Therascreen to analyze surgically resected tissue samples from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutations were observed in 32/59 tumor samples (LAMP) and 33/59 tumor samples (Therascreen). Notably, the LAMP assay identified one tumor as wild-type, which had previously been identified as a deletion mutation in exon 19 via the Therascreen assay (Case X). However, the direct sequencing to confirm the EGFR status of the Case X adhered to the results of the LAMP assay. Further experiments using Case X DNA identified this exon 19 deletion mutation using both methods. In addition, a novel deletion mutation in exon 19 of the EGFR was identified. Overall, the present study shows that the LAMP method may serve as a valuable alternative for the identification oncogene mutations.',\n",
       " 'Gene transcription profiles across tissues are largely defined by the activity of regulatory elements, most of which correspond to regions of accessible chromatin. Regulatory element activity is in turn modulated by genetic variation, resulting in variable transcription rates across individuals. The interplay of these factors, however, is poorly understood. Here we characterize expression and chromatin state dynamics across three tissuesâ\\x80\\x94liver, lung, and kidneyâ\\x80\\x94in 47 strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population, examining the regulation of these dynamics by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and chromatin QTL (cQTL). QTL whose allelic effects were consistent across tissues were detected for 1,101 genes and 133 chromatin regions. Also detected were eQTL and cQTL whose allelic effects differed across tissues, including local-eQTL for Pik3c2g detected in all three tissues but with distinct allelic effects. Leveraging overlapping measurements of gene expression and chromatin accessibility on the same mice from multiple tissues, we used mediation analysis to identify chromatin and gene expression intermediates of eQTL effects. Based on QTL and mediation analyses over multiple tissues, we propose a causal model for the distal genetic regulation of Akr1e1, a gene involved in glycogen metabolism, through the zinc finger transcription factor Zfp985 and chromatin intermediates. This analysis demonstrates the complexity of transcriptional and chromatin dynamics and their regulation over multiple tissues, as well as the value of the CC and related genetic resource populations for identifying specific regulatory mechanisms within cells and tissues.',\n",
       " 'Temperate phages are considered as natural vectors for gene transmission among bacteria due to the ability to integrate their genomes into a host chromosome, therefore, affect the fitness and phenotype of host bacteria. Many virulence genes of pathogenic bacteria were identified in temperate phage genomes, supporting the concept that temperate phages play important roles in increasing the bacterial pathogenicity through delivery of the virulence genes. However, little is known about the roles of temperate phages in attenuation of bacterial virulence. Here, we report a novel Bordetella bronchiseptica temperate phage, vB_BbrS_PHB09 (PHB09), which has a 42,129-bp dsDNA genome with a G+C content of 62.8%. Phylogenetic analysis based on large terminase subunit indicated that phage PHB09 represented a new member of the family Siphoviridae. The genome of PHB09 contains genes encoding lysogen-associated proteins, including integrase and cI protein. The integration site of PHB09 is specifically located within a pilin gene of B. bronchiseptica. Importantly, we found that the integration of phage PHB09 significantly decreased the virulence of parental strain B. bronchiseptica Bb01 in mice, most likely through disruption the expression of pilin gene. Moreover, a single shot of the prophage bearing B. bronchiseptica strain completely protected mice against lethal challenge with wild-type virulent B. bronchiseptica, indicating the vaccine potential of lysogenized strain. Our findings not only indicate the complicated roles of temperate phages in bacterial virulence other than simple delivery of virulent genes but also provide a potential strategy for developing bacterial vaccines.',\n",

Therefore, this study compared midazolam sedation after heart surgery in DS and normal children. We retrospectively reviewed patient records in our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of pediatric cardiovascular operations between March 2015 and March 2018. We selected five days of continuous post-operative data just after termination of muscle relaxants. Midazolam sedation was estimated by Bayesian inference for generalized linear mixed models. We enrolled 104 patients (average age 26 weeks) of which 16 (15%) had DS. DS patients had a high probability of receiving a higher midazolam dosage and dexmedetomidine dosage over the study period (probability = 0.99, probability = 0.97) while depth of sedation was not different in DS patients (probability = 0.35). Multi regression modeling included severity scores and demographic data showed DS decreases midazolam sedation compared with controls (posterior OR = 1.32, 95% CrI = 1.01â\\x80\\x931.75). In conclusion, midazolam dosages should be carefully adjusted as DS significantly decreases midazolam sedative effect in pediatric heart surgery patients.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Protective mechanical ventilation is recommended for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but it usually requires controlled ventilation and sedation. Using neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) or pressure support ventilation (PSV) could have additional benefits, including the use of lower sedative doses, improved patientâ\\x80\\x93ventilator interaction and shortened duration of mechanical ventilation. We designed a pilot study to assess the feasibility of keeping tidal volume (V(T)) at protective levels with NAVA and PSV in patients with ARDS. METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized crossover trial in five ICUs from a university hospital in Brazil and included patients with ARDS transitioning from controlled ventilation to partial ventilatory support. NAVA and PSV were applied in random order, for 15 min each, followed by 3 h in NAVA. Flow, peak airway pressure (Paw) and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) were captured from the ventilator, and a software (Matlab, Mathworks, USA), automatically detected inspiratory efforts and calculated respiratory rate (RR) and V(T). Asynchrony events detection was based on waveform analysis. RESULTS: We randomized 20 patients, but the protocol was interrupted for five (25%) patients for whom we were unable to maintain V(T) below 6.5 mL/kg in PSV due to strong inspiratory efforts and for one patient for whom we could not detect EAdi signal. For the 14 patients who completed the protocol, V(T) was 5.8 Â± 1.1 mL/kg for NAVA and 5.6 Â± 1.0 mL/kg for PSV (p = 0.455) and there were no differences in RR (24 Â± 7 for NAVA and 23 Â± 7 for PSV, p = 0.661). Paw was greater in NAVA (21 Â± 3 cmH(2)O) than in PSV (19 Â± 3 cmH(2)O, p = 0.001). Most patients were under continuous sedation during the study. NAVA reduced triggering delay compared to PSV (p = 0.020) and the median asynchrony Index was 0.7% (0â\\x80\\x932.7) in PSV and 0% (0â\\x80\\x932.2) in NAVA (p = 0.6835). CONCLUSIONS: It was feasible to keep V(T) in protective levels with NAVA and PSV for 75% of the patients. NAVA resulted in similar V(T), RR and Paw compared to PSV. Our findings suggest that partial ventilatory assistance with NAVA and PSV is feasible as a protective ventilation strategy in selected ARDS patients under continuous sedation.

       " 'Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses form the largest and most diverse group of eukaryote-infecting viruses. Their genomes comprise one or more segments of coding-sense RNA that function directly as messenger RNAs upon release into the cytoplasm of infected cells. Positive-sense RNA viruses are generally accepted to encode proteins solely on the positive strand. However, we previously identified a surprisingly long (â\\x88¼1,000-codon) open reading frame (ORF) on the negative strand of some members of the family Narnaviridae which, together with RNA bacteriophages of the family Leviviridae, form a sister group to all other positive-sense RNA viruses. Here, we completed the genomes of three mosquito-associated narnaviruses, all of which have the long reverse-frame ORF. We systematically identified narnaviral sequences in public data sets from a wide range of sources, including arthropod, fungal, and plant transcriptomic data sets. Long reverse-frame ORFs are widespread in one clade of narnaviruses, where they frequently occupy >95 per cent of the genome. The reverse-frame ORFs correspond to a specific avoidance of CUA, UUA, and UCA codons (i.e. stop codon reverse complements) in the forward-frame RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORF. However, absence of these codons cannot be explained by other factors such as inability to decode these codons or GC3 bias. Together with other analyses, we provide the strongest evidence yet of coding capacity on the negative strand of a positive-sense RNA virus. As these ORFs comprise some of the longest known overlapping genes, their study may be of broad relevance to understanding overlapping gene evolution and de novo origin of genes.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Current treatment options for Palmoplantar Pustulosis (PPP), a debilitating chronic skin disease which affects the hands and feet, are limited. The Anakinra for Pustular psoriasis: Response in a Controlled Trial (APRICOT) aims to determine the efficacy of anakinra in the treatment of PPP. This article describes the statistical analysis plan for the final analysis of this two-staged trial, which was determined prior to unblinding and database lock. This is an update to the published protocol and stage one analysis plan. METHODS: APRICOT is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of anakinra versus placebo, with two stages and an adaptive element. Stage one compared treatment arms to ensure proof-of-concept and determined the primary outcome for stage two of the trial. The primary outcome was selected to be the change in Palmoplantar Pustulosis Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes include other investigator-assessed efficacy measures of disease severity, participant-reported measures of efficacy and safety measures. This manuscript describes in detail the outcomes, sample size, general analysis principles, the pre-specified statistical analysis plan for each of the outcomes, the handling of missing outcome data and the planned sensitivity and supplementary analyses for the second stage of the APRICOT trial. DISCUSSION: This statistical analysis plan was developed in compliance with international trial guidelines and is published to increase transparency of the trial analysis. The results of the trial analysis will indicate whether anakinra has a role in the treatment of PPP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISCRTN, ISCRTN13127147. Registered on 1 August 2016.

       " 'BACKGROUND: The number of patients with long-term chronic diseases is increasing. These patients place a strain on health care systems and health care professionals (HCPs). Presently, we aimed to systematically review the literature on HCPsâ\\x80\\x99 experiences working with patients with long-term chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHOD: A systematic search of papers published between 2002 and July 2019 was conducted in the Embase, AMED, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and COCHRANE databases to identify studies reporting qualitative interviews addressing HCPsâ\\x80\\x99 experiences working with adults with COPD, CKD or type 2 diabetes. An interdisciplinary research group were involved in all phases of the study. With the help of NVivo, extracts of each paper were coded, and codes were compared across papers and refined using translational analysis. Further codes were clustered in categories that in turn formed overarching themes. RESULTS: Our comprehensive search identified 4170 citations. Of these, 20 papers met our inclusion criteria. Regarding HCPsâ\\x80\\x99 experiences working with patients with COPD, CKD, or type 2 diabetes, we developed 10 sub-categories that formed three overarching main themes of work experiences: 1) individualizing oneâ\\x80\\x99s professional approach within the clinical encounter; 2) managing oneâ\\x80\\x99s emotions over time; 3) working to maintain professionalism. Overall these three themes suggest that HCPsâ\\x80\\x99 work is a complex balancing act depending on the interaction between patient and professional, reality and professional ideals, and contextual support and managing oneâ\\x80\\x99s own emotions. CONCLUSION: Few qualitative studies highlighted HCPsâ\\x80\\x99 general working experiences, as they mainly focused on the patientsâ\\x80\\x99 experiences or HCPsâ\\x80\\x99 experiences of using particular clinical procedures. This study brings new insights about the complexity embedded in HCPsâ\\x80\\x99 work in terms of weighing different, often contrasting aspects, in order to deliver appropriate practice. Acknowledging, discussing and supporting this complexity can empower HCPs to avoid burning out. Leaders, health organizations, and educational institutions have a particular responsibility to provide HCPs with thorough professional knowledge and systematic support.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Older adults who reside in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are at particularly high risk for infection, morbidity and mortality from pneumonia and influenza (P&I) compared to individuals of younger age and those living outside institutional settings. The risk factors for P&I hospitalizations that are specific to LTCFs remain poorly understood. Our objective was to evaluate the incidence of P&I hospitalization and associated person- and facility-level factors among post-acute (short-stay) and long-term (long-stay) care residents residing in LTCFs from 2013 to 2015. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used Medicare administrative claims linked to Minimum Data Set and LTCF-level data to identify short-stay (< 100 days, index = admission date) and long-stay (100+ days, index = day 100) residents who were followed from the index date until the first of hospitalization, LTCF discharge, Medicare disenrollment, or death. We measured incidence rates (IRs) for P&I hospitalization per 100,000 person-days, and estimated associations with baseline demographics, geriatric syndromes, clinical characteristics, and medication use using Cox regression models. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 1,118,054 short-stay and 593,443 long-stay residents. The crude 30-day IRs (95% CI) of hospitalizations with P&I in the principal position were 26.0 (25.4, 26.6) and 34.5 (33.6, 35.4) among short- and long-stay residents, respectively. The variables associated with P&I varied between short and long-stay residents, and common risk factors included: advanced age (85+ years), admission from an acute hospital, select cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, impaired functional status, and receipt of antibiotics or Beers criteria medications. Facility staffing and care quality measures were important risk factors among long-stay residents but not in short-stay residents. CONCLUSIONS: Short-stay residents had lower crude 30- and 90-day incidence rates of P&I hospitalizations than long-stay LTCF residents. Differences in risk factors for P&I between short- and long-stay populations suggest the importance of considering distinct profiles of post-acute and long-term care residents in infection prevention and control strategies in LTCFs. These findings can help clinicians target interventions to subgroups of LTCF residents at highest P&I risk.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: We analyzed the results of a 3-year surveillance study on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of healthcare associated-infections (HAIs) in elderly inpatients in a large tertiary hospital in China. METHODS: Real-time surveillance was performed from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. All HAIs were identified by infection control practitioners and doctors. Inpatient data were collected with an automatic surveillance system. RESULTS: A total of 134,637 inpatients including 60,332 (44.8%) elderly â\\x89¥60 years were included. The overall incidence of HAI was 2.0%. The incidence of HAI in elderly patients was significantly higher than that in non-elderly patients (2.6% vs. 1.5%, Ï\\x87(2) = 202.421, P < 0.01) and increased with age. The top five sites of HAIs in the elderly were the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, blood stream, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and surgical site. The five most common pathogens detected in elderly HAI patients were Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the elderly was lower than in the non-elderly, catheter-associated urinary tract infections were more common in elderly patients, and the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection was similar between groups. The numbers of male patients and patients with comorbidities and special medical procedures (e.g., intensive care unit admission, cerebrovascular disease, brain neoplasms, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignant tumor, malignant hematonosis, and osteoarthropathy) were significantly higher in the elderly group, but the number of patients who underwent surgery was lower. CONCLUSION: We observed a significantly higher overall incidence of HAI in elderly inpatients â\\x89¥60 compared to non-elderly inpatients < 60 years, but the trend was different for device-associated HAIs, which was attributed to the higher rates of comorbidities and special medical procedures in the elderly group. The main HAI sites in elderly inpatients were the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, and bloodstream, and the main pathogens were gram-negative bacilli and Candida albicans.',\n",
       " 'The primary function of the respiratory system of gas exchange renders it vulnerable to environmental pathogens that circulate in the air. Physical and cellular barriers of the respiratory tract mucosal surface utilize a variety of strategies to obstruct microbe entry. Physical barrier defenses including the surface fluid replete with antimicrobials, neutralizing immunoglobulins, mucus, and the epithelial cell layer with rapidly beating cilia form a near impenetrable wall that separates the external environment from the internal soft tissue of the host. Resident leukocytes, primarily of the innate immune branch, also maintain airway integrity by constant surveillance and the maintenance of homeostasis through the release of cytokines and growth factors. Unfortunately, pathogens such as influenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae require hosts for their replication and dissemination, and prey on the respiratory tract as an ideal environment causing severe damage to the host during their invasion. In this review, we outline the host-pathogen interactions during influenza and post-influenza bacterial pneumonia with a focus on inter- and intra-cellular crosstalk important in pulmonary immune responses.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Influenza is a highly contagious acute viral respiratory tract infection. The emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009 caused a pandemic. Since then it has become a seasonal influenza virus. It causes symptoms ranging from mild to severe illness, which might be fatal, particularly in people with underlying chronic medical conditions, immunocompromised people, the elderly, and pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: Describe the data generated by the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 surveillance in Saudi Arabia from 2010 to 2016. DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive. SETTING: Hospitals reporting to the Ministry of Health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied aggregate data on hospitalized cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Saudi Arabia between 2010 and 2016. The surveillance system used the case definition proposed by the WHO. The cases were confirmed by performing the real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on upper respiratory samples. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Suspected and confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases. SAMPLE SIZE: 113 502 suspected H1N1 cases and 17 094 (15.1%) confirmed cases. RESULTS: Most of the reported cases were registered in the Riyadh region. During the period of the study, the highest number of confirmed cases, 9262 (54.2 %), was in 2015. The case fatality rate for confirmed cases was 3.6%. CONCLUSION: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 showed seasonal trends. The number of suspected influenza cases each year was proportionate to the number of confirmed cases for that year. Riyadh, Jeddah and the Eastern areas (regions with the highest population) reported most of the cases. LIMITATION: Only one strain of H1N1 was tested. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: None.',\n",
       " 'Humoral immune responses initiate in the lymph node draining the site of viral infection (dLN). Some viruses subvert LN B cell activation; however, our knowledge of viral hindrance of B cell responses of important human pathogens is lacking. Here, we define mechanisms whereby chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-transmitted RNA virus that causes outbreaks of acute and chronic arthritis in humans, hinders dLN antiviral B cell responses. Infection of WT mice with pathogenic, but not acutely cleared CHIKV, induced MyD88-dependent recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils to the dLN. Blocking this influx improved lymphocyte accumulation, dLN organization, and CHIKV-specific B cell responses. Both inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (Nox2) contributed to impaired dLN organization and function. Infiltrating monocytes expressed iNOS through a local IRF5- and IFNAR1-dependent pathway that was partially TLR7-dependent. Together, our data suggest that pathogenic CHIKV triggers the influx and activation of monocytes and neutrophils in the dLN that impairs virus-specific B cell responses.',\n",
       " 'Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is an important veterinary pathogen that causes porcine pleuropneumonia. Lipoproteins of bacterial pathogens play pleiotropic roles in the infection process. In addition, many bacterial lipoproteins are antigenic and immunoprotective. Therefore, characterization of lipoproteins is a promising strategy for identification of novel vaccine candidates or diagnostic markers. We cloned 58 lipoproteins from A. pleuropneumoniae JL03 (serovar 3) and expressed them in Escherichia coli. Five proteins with strong positive signals in western blotting analysis were used to immunize mice. These proteins elicited significant antibody responses, and three of them (APJL_0922, APJL_1380 and APJL_1976) generated efficient immunoprotection in mice against lethal heterologous challenge with A. pleuropneumoniae 4074 (serovar 1), both in the active and passive immunization assays. Then immunogenicity of these three lipoproteins (APJL_0922, APJL_1380 and APJL_1976) were further tested in pigs. Results showed that these proteins elicited considerable humoral immune responses and effective protective immunity against virulent A. pleuropneumoniae challenge. Our findings suggest that these three novel lipoproteins could be potential subunit vaccine candidates.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the leading cause of death among preterm infants born at < 30 weeksâ\\x80\\x99 gestation. The incidence of NEC is reduced when infants are fed human milk. However, in many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), it is standard practice to freeze and/or pasteurize human milk, which deactivates bioactive components that may offer additional protective benefits. Indeed, our pilot study showed that one feed of fresh motherâ\\x80\\x99s own milk per day was safe, feasible, and can reduce morbidity in preterm infants. To further evaluate the benefits of fresh human milk in the NICU, a randomized controlled trial is needed. METHODS: Our prospective multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial will include infants born at < 30 weeksâ\\x80\\x99 gestation and admitted to one of 29 tertiary NICUs in China. Infants in the intervention (fresh human milk) group (n = 1549) will receive at least two feeds of fresh human milk (i.e., within 4 h of expression) per day from the time of enrollment until 32 weeksâ\\x80\\x99 corrected age or discharge to home. Infants in the control group (n = 1549) will receive previously frozen human milk following the current standard protocols. Following informed consent, enrolled infants will be randomly allocated to the control or fresh human milk groups. The primary outcome is the composite outcome mortality or NEC â\\x89¥ stage 2 at 32 weeksâ\\x80\\x99 corrected age, and the secondary outcomes are mortality, NEC â\\x89¥ stage 2, NEC needing surgery, late-onset sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), weight gain, change in weight, increase in length, increase in head circumference, time to full enteral feeds, and finally, the number and type of critical incident reports, including feeding errors. DISCUSSION: Our double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial aims to examine whether fresh human milk can improve infant outcomes. The results of this study will impact both Chinese and international medical practice and feeding policy for preterm infants. In addition, data from our study will inform changes in health policy in NICUs across China, such that mothers are encouraged to enter the NICU and express fresh milk for their infants.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Decision-making in public health and health policy is complex and requires careful deliberation of many and sometimes conflicting normative and technical criteria. Several approaches and tools, such as multi-criteria decision analysis, health technology assessments and evidence-to-decision (EtD) frameworks, have been proposed to guide decision-makers in selecting the criteria most relevant and appropriate for a transparent decision-making process. This study forms part of the development of the WHO-INTEGRATE EtD framework, a framework rooted in global health norms and values as reflected in key documents of the World Health Organization and the United Nations system. The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of criteria used in or proposed for real-world decision-making processes, including guideline development, health technology assessment, resource allocation and others. METHODS: We conducted an overview of systematic reviews through a combination of systematic literature searches and extensive reference searches. Systematic reviews reporting criteria used for real-world health decision-making by governmental or non-governmental organization on a supranational, national, or programme level were included and their quality assessed through a bespoke critical appraisal tool. The criteria reported in the reviews were extracted, de-duplicated and sorted into first-level (i.e. criteria), second-level (i.e. sub-criteria) and third-level (i.e. decision aspects) categories. First-level categories were developed a priori using a normative approach; second- and third-level categories were developed inductively. RESULTS: We included 36 systematic reviews providing criteria, of which one met all and another eleven met at least five of the items of our critical appraisal tool. The criteria were subsumed into 8 criteria, 45 sub-criteria and 200 decision aspects. The first-level of the category system comprised the following seven substantive criteria: â\\x80\\x9cHealth-related balance of benefits and harmsâ\\x80\\x9d; â\\x80\\x9cHuman and individual rightsâ\\x80\\x9d; â\\x80\\x9cAcceptability considerationsâ\\x80\\x9d; â\\x80\\x9cSocietal considerationsâ\\x80\\x9d; â\\x80\\x9cConsiderations of equity, equality and fairnessâ\\x80\\x9d; â\\x80\\x9cCost and financial considerationsâ\\x80\\x9d; and â\\x80\\x9cFeasibility and health system considerationsâ\\x80\\x9d. In addition, we identified an eight criterion â\\x80\\x9cEvidenceâ\\x80\\x9d. CONCLUSION: This overview of systematic reviews provides a comprehensive overview of criteria used or suggested for real-world health decision-making. It also discusses key challenges in the selection of the most appropriate criteria and in seeking to implement a fair decision-making process.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the major health and socioeconomic problems in the world. Immune-enhancing enteral formula has been proven to significantly reduce infection rate in TBI patients. One of the ingredients that can be used in immunonutrition formulas to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress is pycnogenol. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work is to survey the effect of pycnogenol on the clinical, nutritional, and inflammatory status of TBI patients. METHODS: This is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Block randomization will be used. An intervention group will receive pycnogenol supplementation of 150 mg for 10 days and a control group will receive a placebo for the same duration. Inflammatory status (IL-6, IL- 1Î², C-reactive protein) and oxidative stress status (malondialdehyde, total antioxidant capacity), at the baseline, at the 5th day, and at the end of the study (10th day) will be measured. Clinical and nutritional status will be assessed three times during the intervention. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) questionnaire for assessment of organ failure will be filled out every other day. The mortality rate will be calculated within 28 days of the start of the intervention. Weight, body mass index, and body composition will be measured. All analyses will be conducted by an initially assigned study arm in an intention-to-treat analysis. DISCUSSION: We expect that supplementation of 150 mg pycnogenol for 10 days will improve clinical and nutritional status and reduce the inflammation and oxidative stress of the TBI patients.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Prolonged and difficult weaning is associated with higher rates of complications and mortality. Therefore, it is important to identify the associated factors. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe our experience with a 37-year-old man diagnosed with severe viral pneumonia (influenza A). He presented with acute respiratory failure type I on admission. During intubation, his blood pressure and heart rate decreased, and epinephrine and norepinephrine were administered. Although his clinical condition improved 8 days after intensive care unit (ICU) admission, he experienced difficulty weaning. He remained conscious but had a poor spontaneous cough with sputum production and weak limb muscle strength. His cough reflex was absent during bronchoscopic sputum suction, and he used abdominal breathing during the T-tube test. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an Arnoldâ\\x80\\x93Chiari malformation type I, posterior dislocation of the odontoid process, and syringomyelia, with compression and deformation of the medulla and high cervical cord. The patient was successfully weaned from the ventilator at 20 days after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Arnoldâ\\x80\\x93Chiari malformation type I and posterior dislocation of the odontoid process, which aggravate medullary compression and increase the risk of cervical nerve injury, might be a rare factor affecting prolonged weaning in critical illness.',\n",
       " 'Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever in humans. While virus-host interactions are promising targets for antivirals, there is only limited knowledge regarding the interactions of EBOV with cellular host factors. Recently, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen that identified the nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1) as an important host factor for the EBOV life cycle. NXF1 is a major component of the nuclear mRNA export pathway that is usurped by many viruses whose life cycles include nuclear stages. However, the role of NXF1 in the life cycle of EBOV, a virus replicating in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, remains unknown. In order to better understand the role of NXF1 in the EBOV life cycle, we performed a combination of co-immunoprecipitation and double immunofluorescence assays to characterize the interactions of NXF1 with viral proteins and RNAs. Additionally, using siRNA-mediated knockdown of NXF1 together with functional assays, we analyzed the role of NXF1 in individual aspects of the virus life cycle. With this approach we identified the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) as a viral interaction partner of NXF1. Further studies revealed that NP interacts with the RNA-binding domain of NXF1 and competes with RNA for this interaction. Co-localization studies showed that RNA binding-deficient, but not wildtype NXF1, accumulates in NP-derived inclusion bodies, and knockdown experiments demonstrated that NXF1 is necessary for viral protein expression, but not for viral RNA synthesis. Finally, our results showed that NXF1 interacts with viral mRNAs, but not with viral genomic RNAs. Based on these results we suggest a model whereby NXF1 is recruited into inclusion bodies to promote the export of viral mRNA:NXF1 complexes from these sites. This would represent a novel function for NXF1 in the life cycle of cytoplasmically replicating viruses, and may provide a basis for new therapeutic approaches against EBOV, and possibly other emerging viruses.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Severe blunt chest injury sometimes induces acute respiratory failure (ARF), requiring ventilator use. We aimed to evaluate the effect of performing rib fixation with the addition of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) on patients with ARF caused by blunt thoracic injury with ventilator dependence. METHODS: This observational study prospectively enrolled patients with multiple bicortical rib fractures with hemothorax caused by severe blunt chest trauma. All patients received positive pressure mechanical ventilation within 24 h after trauma because of ARF. Some patients who received rib fixation with VATS were enrolled as group 1, and the others who received only VATS were designated as group 2. The length of ventilator use was the primary clinical outcome. Rates of pneumonia and length of hospital stay constituted secondary outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were included in this study. The basic demographic characteristics between the two groups exhibited no statistical differences. All patients received operations within 6 days after trauma. The length of ventilator use was shorter in group 1 (3.19 Â± 3.37 days vs. 8.05 Â± 8.23, P = 0.002). The rate of pneumonia was higher in group 2 (38.1% vs. 75.0%, P = 0.005). The length of hospital stay was much shorter in group 1 (17.76 Â± 8.38 days vs. 24.13 Â± 9.80, P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Rib fixation combined with VATS could shorten the length of ventilator use and reduce the pneumonia rate in patients with severe chest blunt injury with ARF. Therefore, this operation could shorten the overall length of hospital stay.',\n",
       " 'Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused significant disease, with widespread cases of neurological pathology and congenital neurologic defects. Rapid vaccine development has led to a number of candidates capable of eliciting potent ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies (reviewed in refs. (1â\\x80\\x933)). Despite advances in vaccine development, it remains unclear how ZIKV vaccination affects immune responses in humans with prior flavivirus immunity. Here we show that a single-dose immunization of ZIKV purified inactivated vaccine (ZPIV)(4â\\x80\\x937) in a dengue virus (DENV)-experienced human elicited potent cross-neutralizing antibodies to both ZIKV and DENV. Using a unique ZIKV virion-based sorting strategy, we isolated and characterized multiple antibodies, including one termed MZ4, which targets a novel site of vulnerability centered on the Envelope (E) domain I/III linker region and protects mice from viremia and viral dissemination following ZIKV or DENV-2 challenge. These data demonstrate that Zika vaccination in a DENV-experienced individual can boost pre-existing flavivirus immunity and elicit protective responses against both ZIKV and DENV. ZPIV vaccination in Puerto Rican individuals with prior flavivirus experience yielded similar cross-neutralizing potency after a single vaccination, highlighting the potential benefit of ZIKV vaccination in flavivirus-endemic areas.',\n",
       " 'Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is highly effective in controlling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 but requires lifelong medication due to the existence of a latent viral reservoir(1,2). Potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) represent a potential alternative or adjuvant to ART. In addition to suppressing viremia, bNAbs may have T cell immunomodulatory effects as seen for other forms of immunotherapy(3). However, this has not been established in individuals who are infected with HIV-1. Here, we document increased HIV-1 Gag-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in the peripheral blood of all nine study participants who were infected with HIV-1 with suppressed blood viremia, while receiving bNAb therapy during ART interruption(4). Increased CD4(+) T cell responses were detected in eight individuals. The increased T cell responses were due both to newly detectable reactivity to HIV-1 Gag epitopes and the expansion of pre-existing measurable responses. These data demonstrate that bNAb therapy during ART interruption is associated with enhanced HIV-1-specific T cell responses. Whether these augmented T cell responses can contribute to bNAb-mediated viral control remains to be determined.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) function evaluation by echocardiography is key in the management of ICU patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), however, it remains challenging. Quantification of RV deformation by speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) is a recently available and reproducible technique that provides an integrated analysis of the RV. However, data are scarce regarding its use in critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to assess its feasibility and clinical usefulness in moderateâ\\x80\\x93severe ARDS patients. RESULTS: Forty-eight ARDS patients under invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) were consecutively enrolled in a prospective observational study. A full transthoracic echocardiography was performed within 36 h of MV initiation. STE-derived and conventional parameters were recorded. Strain imaging of the RV lateral, inferior and septal walls was highly feasible (47/48 (98%) patients). Interobserver reproducibility of RV strain values displayed good reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) > 0.75 for all STE-derived parameters) in ARDS patients. ROC curve analysis showed that lateral, inferior, global (average of the 3 RV walls) longitudinal systolic strain (LSS) and global strain rate demonstrated significant diagnostic values when compared to several conventional indices (TAPSE, Sâ\\x80², RV FAC). A RV global LSS value > â\\x88\\x92 13.7% differentiated patients with a TAPSE < vs > 12 mm with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 83%. Regarding clinical outcomes, mortality and cumulative incidence of weaning from MV at day 28 were not different in patients with normal versus abnormal STE-derived parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Global STE assessment of the RV was highly achievable and reproducible in moderateâ\\x80\\x93severe ARDS patients under MV and additionally correlated with several conventional parameters of RV function. In our cohort, STE-derived parameters did not provide any incremental value in terms of survival or weaning from MV prediction. Further investigations are needed to evaluate their theranostic usefulness. Trial registration NCT02638844: NCT',\n",
       " \"Lassa fever (LF) is increasingly recognised as an important rodent-borne viral haemorrhagic fever presenting a severe public health threat to sub-Saharan West Africa. In 2017â\\x80\\x9318, LF caused an unprecedented epidemic in Nigeria and the situation was worsening in 2018â\\x80\\x9319. This work aims to study the epidemiological features of epidemics in different Nigerian regions and quantify the association between reproduction number (R) and state rainfall. We quantify the infectivity of LF by the reproduction numbers estimated from four different growth models: the Richards, three-parameter logistic, Gompertz and Weibull growth models. LF surveillance data are used to fit the growth models and estimate the Rs and epidemic turning points (Ï\\x84) in different regions at different time periods. Cochran's Q test is further applied to test the spatial heterogeneity of the LF epidemics. A linear random-effect regression model is adopted to quantify the association between R and state rainfall with various lag terms. Our estimated Rs for 2017â\\x80\\x9318 (1.33 with 95% CI 1.29â\\x80\\x931.37) was significantly higher than those for 2016â\\x80\\x9317 (1.23 with 95% CI: (1.22, 1.24)) and 2018â\\x80\\x9319 (ranged from 1.08 to 1.36). We report spatial heterogeneity in the Rs for epidemics in different Nigerian regions. We find that a one-unit (mm) increase in average monthly rainfall over the past 7 months could cause a 0.62% (95% CI 0.20%â\\x80\\x931.05%)) rise in R. There is significant spatial heterogeneity in the LF epidemics in different Nigerian regions. We report clear evidence of rainfall impacts on LF epidemics in Nigeria and quantify the impact.\",\n",
       " 'Lassa virus (LASV) and Mopeia virus (MOPV) are two closely related, rodent-born mammarenaviruses. LASV is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a deadly hemorrhagic fever endemic in West Africa, whereas MOPV is non-pathogenic in humans. The Z matrix protein of arenaviruses is essential to virus assembly and budding by recruiting host factors, a mechanism that remains partially defined. To better characterize the interactions involved, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted using the Z proteins from LASV and MOPV as a bait. The cellular proteins ITCH and WWP1, two members of the Nedd4 family of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases, were found to bind the Z proteins of LASV, MOPV and other arenaviruses. The PPxY late-domain motif of the Z proteins is required for the interaction with ITCH, although the E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of ITCH is not involved in Z ubiquitination. The silencing of ITCH was shown to affect the replication of the old-world mammarenaviruses LASV, MOPV, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and to a lesser extent Lujo virus (LUJV). More precisely, ITCH was involved in the egress of virus-like particles and the release of infectious progeny viruses. Thus, ITCH constitutes a novel interactor of LASV and MOPV Z proteins that is involved in virus assembly and release.',\n",
       " 'Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging zoonotic virus that is transmitted by bats to humans and to pigs, causing severe respiratory disease and often fatal encephalitis. Antibodies directed against the NiV-glycoprotein (G) protein are known to play a major role in clearing NiV infection and in providing vaccine-induced protective immunity. More recently, T cells have been also shown to be involved in recovery from NiV infection. So far, relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of NiV-G that are recognized by CD8 T cells. In this study, NiV-G protein served as the target immunogen to activate NiV-specific cellular immune responses. Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested strain of vaccinia virus for preclinical and clinical vaccine research, was used for the generation of MVAâ\\x80\\x93NiV-G candidate vaccines expressing different versions of recombinant NiV-G. Overlapping peptides covering the entire NiV-G protein were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I/II-restricted T cell responses in type I interferon receptor-deficient (IFNARâ\\x88\\x92/â\\x88\\x92) mice after vaccination with the MVAâ\\x80\\x93NiV-G candidate vaccines. We have identified an H2-b-restricted nonamer peptide epitope with CD8 T cell antigenicity and a H2-b 15mer with CD4 T cell antigenicity in the NiV-G protein. The identification of this epitope and the availability of the MVAâ\\x80\\x93NiV-G candidate vaccines will help to evaluate NiV-G-specific immune responses and the potential immune correlates of vaccine-mediated protection in the appropriate murine models of NiV-G infection. Of note, a soluble version of NiV-G was advantageous in activating NiV-G-specific cellular immune responses using these peptides.',\n",
       " 'Dendritic cells (DCs) are among the first cells that recognize incoming viruses at the mucosal portals of entry. Initial interaction between DCs and viruses facilitates cell activation and migration to secondary lymphoid tissues, where these antigen presenting cells (APCs) prime specific adaptive immune responses. Some viruses, however, have evolved strategies to subvert the migratory capacity of DCs as a way to disseminate infection systemically. Here we focus on the role of Siglec-1, a sialic acid-binding type I lectin receptor potently upregulated by type I interferons on DCs, that acts as a double edge sword, containing viral replication through the induction of antiviral immunity, but also favoring viral spread within tissues. Such is the case for distant enveloped viruses like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or Ebola virus (EBOV), which incorporate sialic acid-containing gangliosides on their viral membrane and are effectively recognized by Siglec-1. Here we review how Siglec-1 is highly induced on the surface of human DCs upon viral infection, the way this impacts different antigen presentation pathways, and how enveloped viruses have evolved to exploit these APC functions as a potent dissemination strategy in different anatomical compartments.',\n",
       " 'The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas and its devastating developmental and neurological manifestations has prompted the development of field-based diagnostics that are rapid, reliable, handheld, specific, sensitive, and inexpensive. The gold standard molecular method for lab-based diagnosis of ZIKV, from either patient samples or insect vectors, is reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The method, however, is costly and requires lab-based equipment and expertise, which severely limits its use as a point-of-care (POC) tool in resource-poor settings. Moreover, given the lack of antivirals or approved vaccines for ZIKV infection, a POC diagnostic test is urgently needed for the early detection of new outbreaks and to adequately manage patients. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a compelling alternative to RT-qPCR for ZIKV and other arboviruses. This low-cost molecular system can be freeze-dried for distribution and exhibits high specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency. A growing body of evidence suggests that LAMP assays can provide greater accessibility to much-needed diagnostics for ZIKV infections, especially in developing countries where the ZIKV is now endemic. This review summarizes the different LAMP methods that have been developed for the virus and summarizes their features, advantages, and limitations.',\n",
       " 'Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has continuously caused severe economic losses to the global swine industries; however, no successful vaccine against PEDV has been developed. In this study, we generated four autologous recombinant viruses, including the highly virulent iPEDVPT-P5, attenuated iPEDVPT-P96, and two chimeric viruses (iPEDVPT-P5-96S and iPEDVPT-P96-5S) with the reciprocally exchanged spike (S) gene, to study the role of the S gene in PEDV pathogenesis. A deeper understanding of PEDV attenuation will aid in the rational design of a live attenuated vaccine (LAV) using reverse genetics system. Our results showed that replacing the S gene from the highly virulent iPEDVPT-P5 led to complete restoration of virulence of the attenuated iPEDVPT-P96, with nearly identical viral shedding, diarrhea pattern, and mortality rate as the parental iPEDVPT-P5. In contrast, substitution of the S gene with that from the attenuated iPEDVPT-P96 resulted in partial attenuation of iPEDVPT-P5, exhibiting similar viral shedding and diarrhea patterns as the parental iPEDVPT-P96 with slightly severe histological lesions and higher mortality rate. Collectively, our data confirmed that the attenuation of the PEDVPT-P96 virus is primarily attributed to mutations in the S gene. However, mutation in S gene alone could not fully attenuate the virulence of iPEDVPT-P5. Gene (s) other than S gene might also play a role in determining virulence.',\n",
       " 'Ebola virus infections lead to severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans and nonhuman primates; and human fatality rates are as high as 67%â\\x80\\x9390%. Since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976, the only available treatments have been medical support or the emergency administration of experimental drugs. The absence of licensed vaccines and drugs against the Ebola virus impedes the prevention of viral infection. In this study, we generated recombinant baculoviruses (rBV) expressing the Sudan virus (SUDV) matrix structural protein (VP40) (rBV-VP40-VP40) or the SUDV glycoprotein (GP) (rBV-GP-GP), and SUDV virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced by co-infection of Sf9 cells with rBV-SUDV-VP40 and rBV-SUDV-GP. The expression of SUDV VP40 and GP in SUDV VLPs was demonstrated by IFA and Western blot analysis. Electron microscopy results demonstrated that SUDV VLPs had a filamentous morphology. The immunogenicity of SUDV VLPs produced in insect cells was evaluated by the immunization of mice. The analysis of antibody responses showed that mice vaccinated with SUDV VLPs and the adjuvant Montanide ISA 201 produced SUDV GP-specific IgG antibodies. Sera from SUDV VLP-immunized mice were able to block infection by SUDV GP pseudotyped HIV, indicating that a neutralizing antibody against the SUDV GP protein was produced. Furthermore, the activation of B cells in the group immunized with VLPs mixed with Montanide ISA 201 was significant one week after the primary immunization. Vaccination with the SUDV VLPs markedly increased the frequency of antigen-specific cells secreting type 1 and type 2 cytokines. To study the therapeutic effects of SUDV antibodies, horses were immunized with SUDV VLPs emulsified in Freundâ\\x80\\x99s complete adjuvant or Freundâ\\x80\\x99s incomplete adjuvant. The results showed that horses could produce SUDV GP-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. These results showed that SUDV VLPs demonstrate excellent immunogenicity and represent a promising approach for vaccine development against SUDV infection. Further, these horse anti-SUDV purified immunoglobulins lay a foundation for SUDV therapeutic drug research.',\n",
       " 'In response to viral infection, host cells activate various antiviral responses to inhibit virus replication. While feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) manipulates the host early innate immune response in many different ways, the host could activate the antiviral response to counteract it through some unknown mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) which serve as a class of regulatory factors in the host, participate in the regulation of the host innate immune response against virus infection. In this study, we found that the expression levels of miR-26a were significantly upregulated upon FHV-1 infection. Furthermore, FHV-1 infection induced the expression of miR-26a via a cGAS-dependent pathway, and knockdown of cellular cGAS significantly blocked the expression of miR-26a induced by poly (dA:dT) or FHV-1 infection. Next, we investigated the biological function of miR-26a during viral infection. miR-26a was able to increase the phosphorylation of STAT1 and promote type I IFN signaling, thus inhibiting viral replication. The mechanism study showed that miR-26a directly targeted host SOCS5. Knockdown of SOCS5 increased the phosphorylation of STAT1 and enhanced the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response, and overexpression of suppressor of the cytokine signalling 5 (SOCS5) decreased the phosphorylation of STAT1 and inhibited the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response. Meanwhile, with the knockdown of SOCS5, the upregulated expression of phosphorylated STAT1 and the anti-virus effect induced by miR-26a were significantly inhibited. Taken together, our data demonstrated a new strategy of host miRNAs against FHV-1 infection by enhancing IFN antiviral signaling.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Septoplasty (surgery to straighten a deviation in the nasal septum) is a frequently performed operation worldwide, with approximately 250,000 performed annually in the US and 22,000 in the UK. Most septoplasties aim to improve diurnal and nocturnal nasal obstruction. The evidence base for septoplasty clinical effectiveness is hitherto very limited. AIMS: To establish, and inform guidance for, the best management strategy for individuals with nasal obstruction associated with a deviated septum. METHODS/DESIGN: A multicentre, mixed-methods, open label, randomised controlled trial of septoplasty versus medical management for adults with a deviated septum and a reduced nasal airway. Eligible patients will have septal deflection visible at nasendoscopy and a nasal symptom score â\\x89¥ 30 on the NOSE questionnaire. Surgical treatment comprises septoplasty with or without reduction of the inferior nasal turbinate on the anatomically wider side of the nose. Medical management comprises a nasal saline spray followed by a fluorinated steroid spray daily for six months. The recruitment target is 378 patients, recruited from up to 17 sites across Scotland, England and Wales. Randomisation will be on a 1:1 basis, stratified by gender and severity (NOSE score). Participants will be followed up for 12 months post randomisation. The primary outcome measure is the total SNOT-22 score at 6 months. Clinical and economic outcomes will be modelled against baseline severity (NOSE scale) to inform clinical decision-making. The study includes a recruitment enhancement process, and an economic evaluation. DISCUSSION: The NAIROS trial will evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of septoplasty versus medical management for adults with a deviated septum and symptoms of nasal blockage. Identifying those individuals most likely to benefit from surgery should enable more efficient and effective clinical decision-making, and avoid unnecessary operations where there is low likelihood of patient benefit.

       " 'BACKGROUND: We sought to develop and test an objective scorecard-based system for assessing and categorizing available research sites in Lassa fever-affected countries based on their preparedness and capability to host Lassa fever vaccine clinical trials. METHODS: We mapped available clinical research sites through interrogation of online clinical trial registries and relevant disease-based consortia. A structured online questionnaire was used to assess the capability of clinical trial sites to conduct Lassa fever vaccine clinical trials. We developed a new scoring template by allocating scores to questionnaire parameters based on perceived importance to the conduct of clinical trials as described in the WHO/TDR Global Competency Framework for Clinical Research. Cutoff points of 75% and 50% were used to categorize sites into categories A, B, or C. RESULTS: This study identified 44 clinical trial sites in 8 Lassa fever-affected countries. Out of these, 35 sites were characterized based on their capacity to hold Lassa fever vaccine clinical trials. A total of 14 sites in 4 countries were identified as ready to host Lassa fever vaccine trials immediately or with little support. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to hold Lassa fever vaccine trials in affected countries based on the outcome of the survey. However, the findings are to be validated through sitesâ\\x80\\x99 visits. This experience with a standardized and objective method of the site assessment is encouraging, and the site selection method used can serve as an orientation to sponsors and researchers planning clinical trials in the region.',\n",
       " 'Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis) causes Johneâ\\x80\\x99s disease in ruminants and is characterized by chronic gastroenteritis leading to heavy economic losses to the dairy industry worldwide. The currently available vaccine (inactivated bacterin in oil base) is not effective in preventing pathogen shedding and is rarely used to control Johneâ\\x80\\x99s disease in dairy herds. To develop a better vaccine that can prevent the spread of Johneâ\\x80\\x99s disease, we utilized polyanhydride nanoparticles (PAN) to encapsulate mycobacterial antigens composed of whole cell lysate (PAN-Lysate) and culture filtrate (PAN-Cf) of M. paratuberculosis. These nanoparticle-based vaccines (i.e., nanovaccines) were well tolerated in mice causing no inflammatory lesions at the site of injection. Immunological assays demonstrated a substantial increase in the levels of antigen-specific T cell responses post-vaccination in the PAN-Cf vaccinated group as indicated by high percentages of triple cytokine (IFN-Î³, IL-2, TNF-Î±) producing CD8(+) T cells. Following challenge, animals vaccinated with PAN-Cf continued to produce significant levels of double (IFN-Î³, TNF-Î±) and single cytokine (IFN-Î³) secreting CD8(+) T cells compared with animals vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine. A significant reduction in bacterial load was observed in multiple organs of animals vaccinated with PAN-Cf, which is a clear indication of protection. Overall, the use of polyanhydride nanovaccines resulted in development of protective and sustained immunity against Johneâ\\x80\\x99s disease, an approach that could be applied to counter other intracellular pathogens.',\n",
       " 'This retrospective study aimed to clarify the short- and mid-term outcomes of elderly patients who underwent surgery to treat left-sided native valve infective endocarditis (LSNIE). Between July 2005 and September 2015, 179 patients underwent surgical treatment for active LSNIE at a single institution. Patients were classified into two groups: â\\x89¥65 years (elderly group) and <65 years (non-elderly group). Clinical features, surgical information, postoperative complications, and three-year survival rates were compared. The average ages were 74.2 Â± 6.4 and 45.2 Â± 12.6 years in the elderly and non-elderly groups, respectively. The elderly group had a higher predicted mortality rate and a lower incidence of preoperative septic emboli-related complications. Echocardiographic assessments of infected valves were generally homogenous between the groups. The elderly patients had a higher in-hospital mortality rate than the non-elderly patients (26.3% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.001). For patients who survived to discharge, the three-year cumulative survival rates were 75.0% Â± 8.2% and 81.2% Â± 3.4% in the elderly and non-elderly groups, respectively (P = 0.484). In conclusion, elderly patients are at a higher risk of in-hospital mortality after surgery for LSNIE. However, once elderly patients are stabilized by surgical treatment and survive to discharge, the mid-term outcomes are promising.',\n",
       " 'Numerous epidemic models have been developed to capture aspects of human contact patterns, making model selection challenging when they fit (often-scarce) early epidemic data equally well but differ in predictions. Here we consider the invasion of a novel directly transmissible infection and perform an extensive, systematic and transparent comparison of models with explicit age and/or household structure, to determine the accuracy loss in predictions in the absence of interventions when ignoring either or both social components. We conclude that, with heterogeneous and assortative contact patterns relevant to respiratory infections, the modelâ\\x80\\x99s age stratification is crucial for accurate predictions. Conversely, the household structure is only needed if transmission is highly concentrated in households, as suggested by an empirical but robust rule of thumb based on household secondary attack rate. This work serves as a template to guide the simplicity/accuracy trade-off in designing models aimed at initial, rapid assessment of potential epidemic severity.',\n",
       " 'The situation of drug resistance has become more complicated due to the scarcity of plant resistance genes, and overcoming this challenge is imperative. Isatis indigotica has been used for the treatment of wounds, viral infections, and inflammation for centuries. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are found in all classes of life ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. To identify AMPs, I. indigotica was explored using a novel, sensitive, and high-throughput Bacillus subtilis screening system. We found that IiR515 and IiR915 exhibited significant antimicrobial activities against a variety of bacterial (Xanthomonas oryzae, Ralstonia solanacearum, Clavibacter michiganensis, and C. fangii) and fungal (Phytophthora capsici and Botrytis cinerea) pathogens. Scanning electron microscope and cytometric analysis revealed the possible mechanism of these peptides, which was to target and disrupt the bacterial cell membrane. This model was also supported by membrane fluidity and electrical potential analyses. Hemolytic activity assays revealed that these peptides may act as a potential source for clinical medicine development. In conclusion, the plant-derived novel AMPs IiR515 and IiR915 are effective biocontrol agents and can be used as raw materials in the drug discovery field.',\n",
       " 'HTLV-1 was the first described human retrovirus and was soon found to be associated with severe clinical diseases, including a devastating lymphoma/leukemia and other inflammatory diseases. Although HTLV-2 is not usually pathogenic, it is widely distributed among native Indian populations in Brazil, particularly in the Amazon region of the country. Presently, HTLV spreads mainly by the sexual route and from mother to child, and virus persistence is an active biological factor aiding its transmission. Recently, the use of illicit drugs has been shown to be an additional risk factor, showing the influence of new habits on the epidemiology of HTLV in the region. Despite the detection of the virus in several different populations in the Amazon region of Brazil for almost 30 years, the exact prevalence of HTLV-1/2 is not well defined. The original biases in sampling and the selection of epidemiologically unsuitable populations were commonly repeated in most prevalence studies, generating unreliable and conflicting figures that do not represent the actual prevalence of HTLV. The improvements in clinical and laboratory facilities have resulted in the description of several clinical manifestations that were previously unknown in the region. The extent of the spread of the virus must be defined in this region, which is the largest geographical area of the country. As prophylaxis advances toward the use of vaccines against HTLV-1, it is important to determine who is at risk of being infected and developing a disease to successfully implement preventive measures, particularly as proposals are made to eradicate the virus among humans.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The number of children requiring long-term home ventilation has consistently increased over the last 25 years. Given the growing population of children with complex care needs (CCNs), this was an important area of focus within the Models of Child Health Appraised (MOCHA) project, funded by the European Union (EU) under the Horizon 2020 programme. We examined the structures and processes of care in place for children with CCNs and identified key constituents for effective integration of care for these children at the community and acute care interface across 30 EU/ European Economic Area (EEA) countries. METHODS: This was a non-experimental descriptive study with an embedded qualitative element. Data were collected by a Country Agent in each of the 30 countries, a local expert in child health services. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and a thematic analysis was undertaken of the free text data provided. RESULTS: A total of 27 surveys were returned from a possible 30 countries (90.0%) countries. One respondent indicated that their country does not have children on long-term ventilation (LTV) in the home, therefore, responses of 26 countries (86.7%) were analysed. None of the responding countries reported that they had all of the core components in place in their country. Three themes emerged from the free text provided: â\\x80\\x98family preparedness for transitioning to homeâ\\x80\\x99, â\\x80\\x98coordinated pathway to specialist careâ\\x80\\x99 and â\\x80\\x98legal and governance structuresâ\\x80\\x99. CONCLUSIONS: While the clinical care of children on LTV in the acute sector has received considerable attention, the results identify the need for an enhanced focus on the care required following discharge to the community setting. The results highlight the need for a commitment to supporting care delivery that acknowledges the complexity of contemporary child health issues and the context of the families that become their primary care givers.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Optimal timing for the start of vasopressors (VP) in septic shock has not been widely studied since it is assumed that fluids must be administered in advance. We sought to evaluate whether a very early start of VP, even without completing the initial fluid loading, might impact clinical outcomes in septic shock. METHODS: A total of 337 patients with sepsis requiring VP support for at least 6 h were initially selected from a prospectively collected database in a 90-bed mixed-ICU during a 24-month period. They were classified into very-early (VE-VPs) or delayed vasopressor start (D-VPs) categories according to whether norepinephrine was initiated or not within/before the next hour of the first resuscitative fluid load. Then, VE-VPs (n = 93) patients were 1:1 propensity matched to D-VPs (n = 93) based on age; source of admission (emergency room, general wards, intensive care unit); chronic and acute comorbidities; and lactate, heart rate, systolic, and diastolic pressure at vasopressor start. A risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model was fitted to assess the association between VE-VPs and day 28 mortality. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed also including those patients requiring VP support for less than 6 h. RESULTS: Patients subjected to VE-VPs received significantly less resuscitation fluids at vasopressor starting (0[0â\\x80\\x93510] vs. 1500[650â\\x80\\x932300] mL, p < 0.001) and during the first 8 h of resuscitation (1100[500â\\x80\\x931900] vs. 2600[1600â\\x80\\x933800] mL, p < 0.001), with no significant increase in acute renal failure and/or renal replacement therapy requirements. VE-VPs was related with significant lower net fluid balances 8 and 24 h after VPs. VE-VPs was also associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death compared to D-VPs (HR 0.31, CI95% 0.17â\\x80\\x930.57, p < 0.001) at day 28. Such association was maintained after including patients receiving vasopressors for < 6 h. CONCLUSION: A very early start of vasopressor support seems to be safe, might limit the amount of fluids to resuscitate septic shock, and could lead to better clinical outcomes.',\n",

However, current seasonal influenza vaccines are only protective against closely matched circulating strains. Even with extensive monitoring and annual reformulation our efforts remain one step behind the rapidly evolving virus, often resulting in mismatches and low vaccine effectiveness. Fortunately, many next-generation influenza vaccines are currently in development, utilizing an array of innovative techniques to shorten production time and increase the breadth of protection. This review summarizes the production methods of current vaccines, recent advances that have been made in influenza vaccine research, and highlights potential challenges that are yet to be overcome. Special emphasis is put on the potential role of glycoengineering in influenza vaccine development, and the advantages of removing the glycan shield on influenza surface antigens to increase vaccine immunogenicity. The potential for future development of these novel influenza vaccine candidates is discussed from an industry perspective.',\n",

Unraveling the involvement of miRNA as a key cellular factor during in vitro canine parvovirus (CPV) infection may facilitate the discovery of potential intervention candidates. However, the examination of miRNA expression profiles in CPV in tissue culture systems has not been fully elucidated. METHOD: In the present study, we utilized high-throughput small RNA-seq (sRNA-seq) technology to investigate the altered miRNA profiling in miRNA libraries from uninfected (Control) and CPV-2c infected Crandell Reese Feline Kidney cells. RESULTS: We identified five of known miRNAs (miR-222-5p, miR-365-2-5p, miR-1247-3p, miR-322-5p and miR-361-3p) and three novel miRNAs (Novel 137, Novel 141 and Novel 102) by sRNA-seq with differentially expressed genes in the miRNA repertoire of CPV-infected cells over control. We further predicted the potential target genes of the aforementioned miRNAs using sequence homology algorithms. Notably, the targets of miR-1247-3p exhibited a potential function associated with cellular defense and humoral response to CPV. To extend the probing scheme for gene targets of miR-1247-3p, we explored and performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of its target genes. We discovered 229 putative targets from a total of 38 enriched GO terms. The top over-represented GO enrichment in biological process were lymphocyte activation and differentiation, marginal zone B cell differentiation, negative regulation of cytokine production, negative regulation of programed cell death, and negative regulation of signaling. We next constructed a GO biological process network composed of 28 target genes of miR-1247-3p, of which, some genes, namely BCL6, DLL1, GATA3, IL6, LEF1, LFNG and WNT1 were among the genes with obviously intersected in multiple GO terms. CONCLUSION: The miRNA-1247-3p and its cognate target genes suggested their great potential as novel therapeutic targets or diagnostic biomarkers of CPV or other related viruses.',\n",

       " 'Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are major microorganisms used for probiotic purposes and prime parts of the human and mammalian gut microbiota, which exert important health-promoting effects on the host. The present study aimed to evaluate and compare the probiotic potential and safety of LAB strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of a wild boar from the Greater Khingan Mountains, China. Amongst all of the isolated LAB strains, five isolates identified as Lactobacillus mucosae, Lactobacillus salivarius, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans, and Enterococcus faecium, were remarkably resistant to acid and bile salt. The probiotic characteristics (including adhesion capability, antimicrobial activities, autoaggregation, and coaggregation abilities), and safety properties (including hemolytic activity, antibiotic resistance, absence/presence of virulence factors, and in vivo safety) were evaluated. The results showed that all five isolates exhibited high adhesive potential, remarkable aggregation capacity, and antibacterial activities. Upon assessment of the safety, these strains were negative for hemolytic activity and all tested virulence genes. In vivo safety assessment showed no adverse effects of isolated strains supplementation on the body weight gain and organ indices of the treated mice. This study revealed that these LAB isolates, especially L. salivarius M2-71, possess desirable probiotic properties and have great potentials for the development of feed additives for animals to promote health.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Usage of chloroquine was discontinued from the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum infection in almost all endemic regions because of global spread of resistant parasites. Since the first report in Malawi, numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the discontinuance led to re-emergence of chloroquine-susceptible P. falciparum, suggesting a possible role in future malaria control. However, most studies were cross-sectional, with few studies looking at the persistence of chloroquine recovery in long term. This study fills the gap by providing, for a period of at least 6 years, proof of persistent re-emergence/stable recovery of susceptible parasite populations using both molecular and phenotypic methods. METHODS: Ex vivo drug-susceptibility assays to chloroquine (n = 319) and lumefantrine (n = 335) were performed from 2013 to 2018 in Gulu, Northern Uganda, where chloroquine had been removed from the official malaria treatment regimen since 2006. Genotyping of pfcrt and pfmdr1 was also performed. RESULTS: Chloroquine resistance (â\\x89¥ 100 nM) was observed in only 3 (1.3%) samples. Average IC(50) values for chloroquine were persistently low throughout the study period (17.4â\\x80\\x9324.9 nM). Parasites harbouring pfcrt K76 alleles showed significantly lower IC(50)s to chloroquine than the parasites harbouring K76T alleles (21.4 nM vs. 43.1 nM, p-value = 3.9 Ã\\x97 10(â\\x88\\x928)). Prevalence of K76 alleles gradually increased from 71% in 2013 to 100% in 2018. CONCLUSION: This study found evidence of stable persistence of chloroquine susceptibility with the fixation of pfcrt K76 in Northern Uganda after discontinuation of chloroquine in the region. Accumulation of similar evidence in other endemic areas in Uganda could open channels for possible future re-use of chloroquine as an option for malaria treatment or prevention.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Optimal antimicrobial drug exposure in the lung is required for successful treatment outcomes for nosocomial pneumonia. Little is known about the intrapulmonary pharmacokinetics (PK) of meropenem when administered by continuous infusion (CI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the PK of two dosages of meropenem (3 g vs 6 g/day by CI) in the plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) in critically ill patients with nosocomial pneumonia. METHODS: Thirty-one patients (81% male, median (IQR) age 72 (22) years) were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Sixteen patients received 1 g/8 h and 15 2 g/8 h by CI (8 h infusion). Plasma and ELF meropenem concentrations were modeled using a population methodology, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate the probability of attaining (PTA) a free ELF concentration of 50% of time above MIC (50% fT>MIC), which results in logarithmic killing and the suppression of resistance in experimental models of pneumonia. RESULTS: The median (IQR) of meropenem AUC(0â\\x80\\x9324 h) in the plasma and ELF was 287.6 (190.2) and 84.1 (78.8) mg h/L in the 1 g/8 h group vs 448.1 (231.8) and 163.0 (201.8) mg h/L in the 2 g/8 h group, respectively. The penetration ratio was approximately 30% and was comparable between the dosage groups. In the Monte Carlo simulations, only the highest approved dose of meropenem of 2 g/8 h by CI allowed to achieve an optimal PTA for all isolates with a MIC < 4 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the dose of meropenem administered by CI achieved a higher exposure in the plasma and ELF. The use of the highest licensed dose of 6 g/day may be necessary to achieve an optimal coverage in ELF for all susceptible isolates (MIC â\\x89¤ 2 mg/L) in patients with conserved renal function. An alternative therapy should be considered when the presence of microorganisms with a MIC greater than 2 mg/L is suspected.

       " 'BACKGROUND: We aimed to synthesize up-to-date trials to validate the effects of neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) use in patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). METHODS: Several databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register were searched up to November 14, 2019. All randomized trials investigating the use of NMBAs in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS and reporting mortality data were included in the meta-analysis. The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were clinical outcomes, including respiratory physiological parameters, incidence of barotrauma, ICU-free days, and ventilation-free days. RESULTS: A total of 7 trials enrolling 1598 patients were finally included in this meta-analysis. The results revealed that the use of NMBAs in moderate-to-severe ARDS could significantly decrease the mortality truncated to day 28 (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.98, P = 0.03) and day 90 (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99, P = 0.04). NMBA use could significantly decrease the incidence of barotrauma (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.87, P = 0.009). No significant difference was observed in ICU-free days or ventilation-free days between the NMBA and control groups. CONCLUSION: The use of NMBAs could significantly decrease mortality in moderate-to-severe ARDS patients and decrease the incidence of barotrauma during mechanical ventilation. However, more large-scale randomized trials are needed to further validate the effect of NMBA use in ARDS.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Whether Borna disease virus (BDV-1) is a human pathogen remained controversial until recent encephalitis cases showed BDV-1 infection could even be deadly. This called to mind previous evidence for an infectious contribution of BDV-1 to mental disorders. Pilot open trials suggested that BDV-1 infected depressed patients benefitted from antiviral therapy with a licensed drug (amantadine) which also tested sensitive in vitro. Here, we designed a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) which cross-linked depression and BDV-1 infection, addressing both the antidepressant and antiviral efficacy of amantadine. METHODS: The interventional phase II RCT (two 7-weeks-treatment periods and a 12-months follow-up) at the Hannover Medical School (MHH), Germany, assigned currently depressed BDV-1 infected patients with either major depression (MD; N = 23) or bipolar disorder (BD; N = 13) to amantadine sulphate (PK-MerzÂ®; twice 100 mg orally daily) or placebo treatment, and contrariwise, respectively. Clinical changes were assessed every 2â\\x80\\x933 weeks by the 21-item Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD) (total, single, and combined scores). BDV-1 activity was determined accordingly in blood plasma by enzyme immune assays for antigens (PAG), antibodies (AB) and circulating immune complexes (CIC). RESULTS: Primary outcomes (â\\x89¥25% HAMD reduction, week 7) were 81.3% amantadine vs. 35.3% placebo responder (p = 0.003), a large clinical effect size (ES; Cohenâ\\x80\\x99s d) of 1.046, and excellent drug tolerance. Amantadine was safe reducing suicidal behaviour in the first 2 weeks. Pre-treatment maximum infection levels were predictive of clinical improvement (AB, p = 0.001; PAG, p = 0.026; HAMD week 7). Respective PAG and CIC levels correlated with AB reduction (p = 0,001 and p = 0.034, respectively). Follow-up benefits (12 months) correlated with dropped cumulative infection measures over time (p < 0.001). In vitro, amantadine concentrations as low as 2.4â\\x80\\x9310 ng/mL (50% infection-inhibitory dose) prevented infection with human BDV Hu-H1, while closely related memantine failed up to 100,000-fold higher concentration (200 Î¼g/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate profound antidepressant efficacy of safe oral amantadine treatment, paralleling antiviral effects at various infection levels. This not only supports the paradigm of a link of BDV-1 infection and depression. It provides a novel possibly practice-changing low cost mental health care perspective for depressed BDV-1-infected patients addressing global needs.

       " 'Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is an important pathogen that causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children worldwide. hMPV has two major genotypes, hMPV-A and hMPV-B. Epidemiological studies have shown that the two hMPV genotypes alternate in predominance worldwide in recent years. Co-circulation of the two genotypes of hMPV was usually observed and there is no study about the interaction between them, such as competitive replication, which maybe the possible mechanisms for alternating prevalence of subtypes. Our present study have used two different genotypes of hMPV (genotype A: NL/1/00; B: NL/1/99) in different proportions in animal model (BALB/c mice) and cell model (Vero-E6) separately. The result showed that the competitive growth does exist in BALB/c mice, genotype B had a strong competitive advantage. However, genotype B did not cause more severe disease than non-predominant (genotype A) or mixed strains in the study, which were evaluated by the body weight, airway hyperresponsiveness and lung pathology of mouse. In cell model, competitive growth and the two genotypes alternately prevalence were observed. In summary, we confirmed that there was a competitive replication between hMPV genotype A and B, and no difference in disease severity caused by the two subtypes. This study shows a new insight to understand the alternation of hMPV genotype prevalence through genotype competition and provide experimental evidence for disease control and vaccine design.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Miller Fisher syndrome is a variant of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy classically characterized by ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and areflexia. Miller Fisher syndrome can present with uncommon symptoms such as bulbar, facial, and somatic muscle palsies and micturition disturbance. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 76-year-old white man with new-onset ataxia, stridor, areflexia, and upper and lower extremity weakness who required intubation at presentation. An initial work-up including imaging studies and serum tests was inconclusive. Eventually, neurophysiological testing and cerebrospinal fluid analysis suggested a diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome. Our patient responded to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and supportive therapy. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of acute or subacute descending paralysis with involvement of bulbar muscles and respiratory failure can often divert clinicians to a diagnosis of neuromuscular junction disorders (such as botulism or myasthenia gravis), vascular causes like stroke, or electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities. Early identification of Miller Fisher syndrome with appropriate testing is essential to prompt treatment and prevention of further, potentially fatal, deterioration.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Novel methods are necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality of patients suffering from infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Being the most common infectious species of the Pseudomonas genus, P. aeruginosa is the primary Gram-negative etiology responsible for nosocomial infections. Due to the ubiquity and high adaptability of this species, an effective universal treatment method for P. aeruginosa infection still eludes investigators, despite the extensive research in this area. RESULTS: We report bacterial inhibition by iron-oxide (nominally magnetite) nanoparticles (NPs) alone, having a mean hydrodynamic diameter of ~ 16 nm, as well as alginate-capped iron-oxide NPs. Alginate capping increased the average hydrodynamic diameter to ~ 230 nm. We also investigated alginate-capped iron-oxide NP-drug conjugates, with a practically unchanged hydrodynamic diameter of ~ 232 nm. Susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the NPs, NP-tobramycin conjugates, and tobramycin alone were determined in the PAO1 bacterial colonies. Investigations into susceptibility using the disk diffusion method were done after 3 days of biofilm growth and after 60 days of growth. MIC of all compounds of interest was determined after 60-days of growth, to ensure thorough establishment of biofilm colonies. CONCLUSIONS: Positive inhibition is reported for uncapped and alginate-capped iron-oxide NPs, and the corresponding MICs are presented. We report zero susceptibility to iron-oxide NPs capped with polyethylene glycol, suggesting that the capping agent plays a major role in enabling bactericidal ability in of the nanocomposite. Our findings suggest that the alginate-coated nanocomposites investigated in this study have the potential to overcome the bacterial biofilm barrier. Magnetic field application increases the action, likely via enhanced diffusion of the iron-oxide NPs and NP-drug conjugates through mucin and alginate barriers, which are characteristic of cystic-fibrosis respiratory infections. We demonstrate that iron-oxide NPs coated with alginate, as well as alginate-coated magnetiteâ\\x80\\x93tobramycin conjugates inhibit P. aeruginosa growth and biofilm formation in established colonies. We have also determined that susceptibility to tobramycin decreases for longer culture times. However, susceptibility to the iron-oxide NP compounds did not demonstrate any comparable decrease with increasing culture time. These findings imply that iron-oxide NPs are promising lower-cost alternatives to silver NPs in antibacterial coatings, solutions, and drugs, as well as other applications in which microbial abolition or infestation prevention is sought.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: According to the World Health Organization reports, billions of people around the world are at risk for malaria disease and it is important to consider the preventive strategies for protecting the people that are living in high risk areas. One of the main reasons of disease survival is diversity of vectors and parasites in different malaria regions that have their specific features, behaviour and biology. Therefore, specific regional strategies are necessary for successful control of malaria. One of the tools that needs to be developed for elimination and prevention of reintroduction of malaria is a vaccine that interrupt malaria transmission (VIMTs). VIMT is a broad concept that should be adjusted to the biological characteristics of the disease in each region. One type of VIMT is a vector-based vaccine that affects the sexual stage of Plasmodium life cycle. According to recent studies, the aminopeptidase N-1 of Anopheles gambiae (AgAPN-1) is as a potent vector-based VIMT with considerable inhibition activity against the sexual stage of Plasmodium parasite. METHODS: Systems for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3Ê¹-RACE) and genome walking methods were used for sequence determination of apn-1 gene from Anopheles stephensi and distinct bioinformatics software were used for structural analysis. AsAPN-1 was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell line using the baculovirus expression system. Recombinant AsAPN-1 was purified under the hybrid condition and its biological activity was assayed. RESULTS: Asapn-1 gene and its coded protein from An. stephensi were characterized for the first time in this study. Subsequently, the structural features and immunological properties of its coded protein were evaluated by in silico approaches. Enzymatic activity of the recombinant AsAPN-1, which was expressed in Sf9 insect cell line, was equal to 6 unit/Î¼l. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study revealed that AsAPN-1 is very similar to its counterpart in An. gambiae. In silico evaluation and fundamental data which are necessary for its evaluation as a VIMT-based vaccine in the next steps were acquired in this study and those could be useful for research groups that study on malaria vaccine for countries that An. stephensi is the main malaria vector there.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Intraoperative driving pressure (Î\\x94P) is associated with development of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC). When tidal volume (V(T)) is kept constant, Î\\x94P may change according to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)-induced changes in lung aeration. Î\\x94P may decrease if PEEP leads to a recruitment of collapsed lung tissue but will increase if PEEP mainly causes pulmonary overdistension. This study tests the hypothesis that individualized high PEEP, when compared to fixed low PEEP, protects against PPC in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery. METHODS: The â\\x80\\x9cDriving prESsure durIng GeNeral AnesThesIa for Open abdomiNal surgery trialâ\\x80\\x9d (DESIGNATION) is an international, multicenter, two-group, double-blind randomized clinical superiority trial. A total of 1468 patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two intraoperative ventilation strategies. Investigators screen patients aged â\\x89¥ 18 years and with a body mass index â\\x89¤ 40 kg/m(2), scheduled for open abdominal surgery and at risk for PPC. Patients either receive an intraoperative ventilation strategy with individualized high PEEP with recruitment maneuvers (RM) (â\\x80\\x9cindividualized high PEEPâ\\x80\\x9d) or one in which PEEP of 5 cm H(2)O without RM is used (â\\x80\\x9clow PEEPâ\\x80\\x9d). In the â\\x80\\x9cindividualized high PEEPâ\\x80\\x9d group, PEEP is set at the level at which Î\\x94P is lowest. In both groups of the trial, V(T) is kept at 8 mL/kg predicted body weight. The primary endpoint is the occurrence of PPC, recorded as a collapsed composite of adverse pulmonary events. DISCUSSION: DESIGNATION will be the first randomized clinical trial that is adequately powered to compare the effects of individualized high PEEP with RM versus fixed low PEEP without RM on the occurrence of PPC after open abdominal surgery. The results of DESIGNATION will support anesthesiologists in their decisions regarding PEEP settings during open abdominal surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03884543.

       " 'BACKGROUND: The influenza virus spreads rapidly around the world in seasonal epidemics, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Influenza-related incidence data are limited in many countries in Africa despite established sentinel surveillance. This study aimed to address the information gap by estimating the burden and seasonality of medically attended influenza like illness in Ethiopia. METHOD: Influenza sentinel surveillance data collected from 3 influenza like illness (ILI) and 5 Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) sites from 2012 to 2017 was used for analysis. Descriptive statistics were applied for simple analysis. The proportion of medically attended influenza positive cases and incidence rate of ILI was determined using total admitted patients and catchment area population. Seasonality was estimated based on weekly trend of ILI and predicted threshold was done by applying the â\\x80\\x9cMoving Epidemic Method (MEM)â\\x80\\x9d. RESULT: A total of 5715 medically attended influenza suspected patients who fulfills ILI and SARI case definition (77% ILI and 23% SARI) was enrolled. Laboratory confirmed influenza virus (influenza positive case) among ILI and SARI suspected case was 25% (1130/4426) and 3% (36/1289). Of which, 65% were influenza type A. The predominantly circulating influenza subtype were seasonal influenza A(H3N2) (n = 455, 60%) and Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (n = 293, 38.81%). The estimated mean annual influenza positive case proportion and ILI incidence rate was 160.04 and 52.48 per 100,000 population. The Incidence rate of ILI was higher in the age group of 15â\\x80\\x9344 years of age [â\\x80\\x98Incidence rate (R) = 254.6 per 100,000 populationâ\\x80\\x99, 95% CI; 173.65, 335.55] and 5â\\x80\\x9314 years of age [R = 49.5, CI 95%; 31.47, 130.43]. The seasonality of influenza has two peak seasons; in a period from Octoberâ\\x80\\x93December and from Aprilâ\\x80\\x93June. CONCLUSION: Significant morbidity of influenza like illness was observed with two peak seasons of the year and seasonal influenza A (H3N2) remains the predominantly circulating influenza subtype.

       " 'A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The ACE2-Fc therapy would also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).',\n",
       " 'A simple susceptibleâ\\x80\\x93infectiousâ\\x80\\x93removed epidemic model for smallpox, with birth and death rates based on historical data, produces oscillatory dynamics with remarkably accurate periodicity. Stochastic population data cause oscillations to be sustained rather than damped, and data analysis regarding the oscillations provides insights into the same set of population data. Notably, oscillations arise naturally from the model, instead of from a periodic forcing term or other exogenous mechanism that guarantees oscillation: the model has no such mechanism. These emergent natural oscillations display appropriate periodicity for smallpox, even when the model is applied to different locations and populations. The model and datasets, in turn, offer new observations about disease dynamics and solution trajectories. These results call for renewed attention to relatively simple models, in combination with datasets from real outbreaks.',\n",
       " 'In ecological systems, heterogeneous interactions between pathogens take place simultaneously. This occurs, for instance, when two pathogens cooperate, while at the same time, multiple strains of these pathogens co-circulate and compete. Notable examples include the cooperation of human immunodeficiency virus with antibiotic-resistant and susceptible strains of tuberculosis or some respiratory infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. Models focusing on competition or cooperation separately fail to describe how these concurrent interactions shape the epidemiology of such diseases. We studied this problem considering two cooperating pathogens, where one pathogen is further structured in two strains. The spreading follows a susceptible-infected-susceptible process and the strains differ in transmissibility and extent of cooperation with the other pathogen. We combined a mean-field stability analysis with stochastic simulations on networks considering both well-mixed and structured populations. We observed the emergence of a complex phase diagram, where the conditions for the less transmissible, but more cooperative strain to dominate are non-trivial, e.g. non-monotonic boundaries and bistability. Coupled with community structure, the presence of the cooperative pathogen enables the coexistence between strains by breaking the spatial symmetry and dynamically creating different ecological niches. These results shed light on ecological mechanisms that may impact the epidemiology of diseases of public health concern.',\n",
       " 'Eliciting protective titers of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is a goal of HIV-1 vaccine development, but current vaccine strategies have yet to induce bnAbs in humans. Many bnAbs isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals are encoded by immunoglobulin gene rearrangments with infrequent naive B cell precursors and with unusual genetic features that may be subject to host regulatory control. Here, we administer antibodies targeting immune cell regulatory receptors CTLA-4, PD-1 or OX40 along with HIV envelope (Env) vaccines to rhesus macaques and bnAb immunoglobulin knock-in (KI) mice expressing diverse precursors of CD4 binding site HIV-1 bnAbs. CTLA-4 blockade augments HIV-1 Env antibody responses in macaques, and in a bnAb-precursor mouse model, CTLA-4 blocking or OX40 agonist antibodies increase germinal center B and T follicular helper cells and plasma neutralizing antibodies. Thus, modulation of CTLA-4 or OX40 immune checkpoints during vaccination can promote germinal center activity and enhance HIV-1 Env antibody responses.',\n",
       " 'Oral rabies vaccination (ORV) is highly effective in foxes and raccoon dogs, whereas for unknown reasons the efficacy of ORV in other reservoir species is less pronounced. To investigate possible variations in species-specific cell tropism and local replication of vaccine virus, different reservoir species including foxes, raccoon dogs, raccoons, mongooses, dogs and skunks were orally immunised with a highly attenuated, high-titred GFP-expressing rabies virus (RABV). Immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR screenings revealed clear differences among species suggesting host specific limitations to ORV. While for responsive species the palatine tonsils (tonsilla palatina) were identified as a main site of virus replication, less virus dissemination was observed in the tonsils of rather refractory species. While our comparison of vaccine virus tropism emphasizes the important role that the tonsilla palatina plays in eliciting an immune response to ORV, our data also indicate that other lymphoid tissues may have a more important role than originally anticipated. Overall, these data support a model in which the susceptibility to oral live RABV vaccine infection of lymphatic tissue is a major determinant in vaccination efficacy. The present results may help to direct future research for improving vaccine uptake and efficacy of oral rabies vaccines under field conditions.',\n",

       " \"Cooperation is a fundamental behaviour observed in all forms of life. The evolution of cooperation has been widely studied, but almost all theories focused on the cooperating individual and its genes. We suggest a different approach, taking into account the microbes carried by the interacting individuals. Accumulating evidence reveals that microbes can affect their host's well-being and behaviour, yet hosts can evolve mechanisms to resist the manipulations of their microbes. We thus propose that coevolution of microbes with their hosts may favour microbes that induce their host to cooperate. Using computational modelling, we show that microbe-induced cooperation can evolve and be maintained in a wide range of conditions, including when facing hosts' resistance to the microbial effect. We find that hostâ\\x80\\x93microbe coevolution leads the population to a rockâ\\x80\\x93paperâ\\x80\\x93scissors dynamics that enables maintenance of cooperation in a polymorphic state. Our results suggest a mechanism for the evolution and maintenance of cooperation that may be relevant to a wide variety of organisms, including cases that are difficult to explain by current theories. This study provides a new perspective on the coevolution of hosts and their microbiome, emphasizing the potential role of microbes in shaping their host's behaviour.\",\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: A key focus of health systems strengthening in low- and middle-income countries is increasing reach and access through task-shifting. As such models become more common, it is critical to understand the experiences of lay providers because they are on the forefront for delivering care services. A greater understanding would improve lay provider support and help them provide high-quality care. This is especially the case for those providing mental health services, as providing psychological care may pose unique stressors. We sought to understand experiences of lay counselors, focusing on identity, motivation, self-efficacy, stress, and burnout. The goal was to understand how taking on a new provider role influences their lives beyond simply assuming a new task, which would in turn help identify actionable steps to improve interventions with task-shifting components. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews (n = 20) and focus group discussions (n = 3) were conducted with three lay counselor groups with varying levels of experience delivering a community-based family therapy intervention in Eldoret, Kenya. Thematic analysis was conducted, including intercoder reliability checks. A Stress Map was created to visualize stress profiles using free-listing and pile-sorting data collected during interviews and focus group discussions. RESULTS: Counselors described high intrinsic motivation to become counselors and high self-efficacy after training. They reported positive experiences in the counselor role, with new skills improving their counseling and personal lives. As challenges arose, including client engagement difficulties and balancing many responsibilities, stress and burnout increased, dampening motivation and self-efficacy. In response, counselors described coping strategies, including seeking peer and supervisor support, that restored their motivation to persevere. At case completion, they again experienced high self-efficacy and a desire to continue. CONCLUSIONS: Findings informed suggestions for ways to incorporate support for lay providers into task-shifting interventions at initiation, during training, and throughout implementation. These include acknowledging and preparing counselors for challenges during training, increasing explicit attention to counselor stress in supervision, fostering peer support among lay providers, and ensuring a fair balance between workload and compensation. Improving and building an evidence base around practices for supporting lay providers will improve the effectiveness and sustainability of lay provider-delivered interventions.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The mechanisms and pathways to impacts from public health research in the UK have not been widely studied. Through the lens of one funder (NIHR), our aims are to map the diversity of public health research, in terms of funding mechanisms, disciplinary contributions, and public health impacts, identify examples of impacts, and pathways to impact that existing reporting mechanisms may not otherwise have captured, and provide illustrations of how public health researchers perceive the generation of non-academic impact from their work. METHODS: A total of 1386 projects were identified as â\\x80\\x98public health researchâ\\x80\\x99 by the NIHR and listed in the NIHR Public Health Overview database (2000â\\x80\\x932016). From these, a subset of 857 projects were matched as potentially having begun reporting impacts via an external data-gathering platform (Researchfish). Data on the 857 projects were analyzed quantitatively, and nine projects were selected to investigate further through semi-structured interviews with principal investigators. Two workshops took place to validate emerging and final findings and facilitate analysis. RESULTS: In addition to the NIHR School for Public Health Research and the NIHR Public Health Research Programme, 89% of projects contained in the NIHR Public Health Overview portfolio as â\\x80\\x98public health researchâ\\x80\\x99 are funded via other NIHR research programmes, suggesting significant diversity in disciplines contributing to public health research and outcomes. The pathways to impact observed in our in-depth case studies include contributing to debates on what constitutes appropriate evidence for national policy change, acknowledging local â\\x80\\x98unintendedâ\\x80\\x99 impacts, building trusted relationships with stakeholders across health and non-health sectors and actors, collaborating with local authorities, and using non-academic dissemination channels. CONCLUSIONS: Public health as a discipline contributes substantially to impact beyond academia. To support the diversity of these impacts, we need to recognise localized smaller-scale impacts, and the difference in types of evidence required for community and local authority-based impacts. This will also require building capacity and resources to enable impact to take place from public health research. Finally, support is required for engagement with local authorities and working with non-health sectors that contribute to health outcomes.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The emergence of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus was reported in Wenshan City, southwestern China in 2017. The study describes the epidemiological and virological features of the outbreak and discusses the origin of the infection. METHODS: Poultry exposure and timelines of key events for each patient were collected. Samples derived from the patients, their close contacts, and environments were tested for influenza A(H7N9) virus by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Genetic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were also conducted. RESULTS: Five patients were reported in the outbreak. An epidemiological investigation showed that all patients had been exposed at live poultry markets. The A(H7N9) isolates from these patients had low pathogenicity in avian species. Both epidemiological investigations of chicken sources and phylogenetic analysis of viral gene sequences indicated that the source of infection was from Guangxi Province, which lies 100 km to the east of Wenshan City. CONCLUSIONS: In the study, a sudden emergence of human cases of H7N9 was documented in urban area of Wenshan City. Chickens were an important carrier in the H7N9 virus spreading from Guangxi to Wenshan. Hygienic management of live poultry markets and virological screening of chickens transported across regions should be reinforced to limit the spread of H7N9 virus.',\n",
       " 'This paper presents the performance of two eukaryotic genomic ribosomal regions, ITS1 and ITS2, in describing fungal diversity in aerosol samples using amplicon-based High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS). Composting sites, biomethanization facilities, and dairy farms, all affected by the presence of fungi, were visited to collect air samples. The amplicon-based HTS approach is a target enrichment method that relies on the amplification of a specific target using particular primers before sequencing. Thus, the results are highly dependent on the quality of amplification. For this reason, the authors of this paper used a shotgun metagenomic approach to compare its outcome with the amplicon-based method. Indeed, shotgun metagenomic does not rely on any amplification prior to sequencing, because all genes are sequenced without a specific target. In addition, culture methods were added to the analyses in biomethanization and dairy farms samples to validate their contribution to fungal diversity of aerosols. The results obtained are unequivocal towards ITS1 outperformance to ITS2 in terms of richness, and taxonomic coverage. The differential abundance analysis did demonstrate that some taxa were exclusively detected only by ITS2, and vice-versa for ITS1. However, the shotgun metagenomic approach showed a taxonomic profile more resembling to ITS1 than ITS2. Based on these results, neither of the barcodes evaluated is perfect in terms of distinguishing all species. Using both barcodes offers a broader view of the fungal aerosol population. However, with the actual knowledge, the authors strongly recommend using ITS1 as a universal fungal barcode for quick general analyses of diversity and when limited financial resources are available, primarily due its ability to capture taxonomic profiles similar to those obtained using the shotgun metagenomic. The culture comparison with amplicon-based sequencing showed the complementarity of both approaches in describing the most abundant taxa.',\n",
       " 'Acute aortic syndromes (AASs) are difficult to diagnose emergencies. Plasma soluble ST2 (sST2), a prognostic biomarker for heart failure, has been proposed as a diagnostic biomarker of AASs outperforming D-dimer, the current diagnostic standard. We performed a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of sST2 for AASs in the Emergency Department (ED). In 2017â\\x80\\x932018, patients were enrolled if they had â\\x89¥1 red-flag symptoms (chest/abdominal/back pain, syncope, perfusion deficit) and a clinical suspicion of AAS. sST2 was detected with the PresageÂ® assay. Adjudication was based on computed tomography angiography (CTA) or on diagnostic outcome inclusive of 30-day follow-up. 297 patients were enrolled, including 88 with AASs. The median age was 67 years. In 162 patients with CTA, the median sST2 level was 41.7 ng/mL (IQR 29.4â\\x80\\x93103.2) in AASs and 34.6 ng/mL (IQR 21.4â\\x80\\x9351.5) in alternative diagnoses (P = 0.005). In ROC analysis, the AUC of sST2 was 0.63, as compared to 0.82 of D-dimer (P < 0.001). Sensitivity and specificity values of sST2 associated with different cutoffs were: 95.5% and 10.8% (â\\x89¥12 ng/mL), 84.1% and 29.7% (â\\x89¥23.7 ng/mL), 35.2% and 85.1% (â\\x89¥66.5 ng/mL). Results were similar in the full cohort. In conclusion, in patients from a European ED, plasma sST2 provided modest accuracy for diagnosis of AASs.',\n",
       " 'UV light is a widely-employed, and environmentally-sensitive bactericide but its mechanism of action is not fully defined. Proteins are major chromophores and targets for damage due to their abundance, but the role of proteins in inducing damage to bound DNA, and the effects on DNA-protein interactions is less well characterized. In E. coli (and other Gram-negative bacteria) the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP/CAP) regulates more than 500 genes. In this study we show that exposure of isolated dimeric CRP-cAMP to UV modifies specific Met, Trp, Tyr, and Pro side-chains, induces inter-protein Tyr63-Tyr41 cross-links, and decreases DNA binding via oxidation of Met114/Pro110 residues in close proximity at the CRP dimer interface. UV exposure also modifies DNA-bound cAMP-CRP, with this resulting in DNA cleavage at specific G/C residues within the sequence bound to CRP, but not at other G/C sites. Oxidation also increases CRP dissociation from DNA. The modifications at the CRP dimer interface, and the site-specific DNA strand cleavage are proposed to occur via oxidation of two species Met residues (Met114 and Met189, respectively) to reactive persulfoxides that damage neighbouring amino acids and DNA bases. These data suggest that modification to CRP, and bound DNA, contributes to UV sensitivity.',\n",
       " 'The recommended antiviral drugs available for the treatment and prevention of influenza are neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs). The aim of this study was to evaluate age-related clinical manifestations of adverse events (AEs) related to NAIs. FAERS and WebMD data were downloaded. The available NAIs selected for the analysis were oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir. Disproportionality was analyzed using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the reporting odds ratio (ROR), and the information component (IC) methods. In total, 16729 AEs from 4598 patients and 575 AEs from 440 patients in the FAERS and WebMD, respectively, were included in the analysis. In the FAERS, AEs were more common among those who were younger (<19 years) for zanamivir, while for those who were older (>65 years) for peramivir. A disproportionality analysis showed that signals for vomiting and hallucinations were detected in younger patients given oseltamivir, while an abnormal hepatic function, cardiac failure, shock, and cardio-respiratory arrest were detected in older patients given peramivir. Psychiatric disorders were most common in younger and older patients, while gastrointestinal disorders were most common in adult given oseltamivir in the WebMD. Adverse symptoms related to NAIs varied and depended on the drugs used and the age of the patient.',\n",
       " 'Emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance calls for development of non-chemical treatment options for bacterial infections. Plasma medicine applies low-temperature plasma (LTP) physics to address biomedical problems such as wound healing and tumor suppression. LTP has also been used for surface disinfection. However, there is still much to be learned regarding the effectiveness of LTP on bacteria in suspension in liquids, and especially on porous surfaces. We investigated the efficacy of LTP treatments against bacteria using an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet and show that LTP treatments have the ability to inhibit both gram-positive (S. aureus) and gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria on solid and porous surfaces. Additionally, both direct LTP treatment and plasma-activated media were effective against the bacteria suspended in liquid culture. Our data indicate that reactive oxygen species are the key mediators of the bactericidal effects of LTP and hydrogen peroxide is necessary but not sufficient for antibacterial effects. In addition, our data suggests that bacteria exposed to LTP do not develop resistance to further treatment with LTP. These findings suggest that this novel atmospheric-pressure plasma jet could be used as a potential alternative to antibiotic treatments in vivo.',\n",
       " 'Hookworms are intestinal parasites that cause major public health problems, especially in developing countries. To differentiate eggs from different hookworm species, it is necessary to use molecular methodologies, since the eggs are morphologically similar. Here, we performed the molecular identification of single hookworm eggs from six Brazilian states. Of the 634 eggs individually analyzed, 98.1% (622/634) represented Necator americanus, and surprisingly, 1.9% (12/634 eggs from the same patient) represented Ancylostoma caninum. DNA analysis of the A. caninum-positive stool sample revealed no contamination with animal feces. This is the first report of the presence of A. caninum eggs in human feces, which may have a direct implication for the epidemiology of hookworm infection caused by this species. This suggests the need for special attention regarding prophylaxis, as different reservoirs, previously not described, may have great relevance for the spread of A. caninum.',\n",
       " 'The vaccine elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 is a long-sought goal. We previously reported the amino-terminal eight residues of the HIV-1-fusion peptide (FP8) â\\x80\\x93 when conjugated to the carrier protein, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) â\\x80\\x93 to be capable of inducing broadly neutralizing responses against HIV-1 in animal models. However, KLH is a multi-subunit particle derived from a natural source, and its manufacture as a clinical product remains a challenge. Here we report the preclinical development of recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (rTTHC) linked to FP8 (FP8-rTTHC) as a suitable FP-conjugate vaccine immunogen. We assessed 16 conjugates, made by coupling the 4 most prevalent FP8 sequences with 4 carrier proteins: the aforementioned KLH and rTTHC; the H. influenzae protein D (HiD); and the cross-reactive material from diphtheria toxin (CRM197). While each of the 16 FP8-carrier conjugates could elicit HIV-1-neutralizing responses, rTTHC conjugates induced higher FP-directed responses overall. A Sulfo-SIAB linker yielded superior results over an SM(PEG)2 linker but combinations of carriers, conjugation ratio of peptide to carrier, or choice of adjuvant (Adjuplex or Alum) did not significantly impact elicited FP-directed neutralizing responses in mice. Overall, SIAB-linked FP8-rTTHC appears to be a promising vaccine candidate for advancing to clinical assessment.',\n",
       " 'The repeating unit of the C. difficile Toxin A (rARU, also known as CROPS [combined repetitive oligopeptides]) C-terminal region, was shown to elicit protective immunity against C. difficile and is under consideration as a possible vaccine against this pathogen. However, expression of recombinant rARU in E. coli using the standard vaccine production process was very low. Transcriptome and proteome analyses showed that at restricted dissolved oxygen (DO) the numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was 2.5-times lower than those expressed at unrestricted oxygen. Additionally, a 7.4-times smaller number of ribosome formation genes (needed for translation) were down-regulated as compared with unrestricted DO. Higher rARU expression at restricted DO was associated with up-regulation of 24 heat shock chaperones involved in protein folding and with the up-regulation of the global regulator RNA chaperone hfq. Cellular stress response leading to down-regulation of transcription, translation, and energy generating pathways at unrestricted DO were associated with lower rARU expression. Investigation of the C. difficile DNA sequence revealed the presence of cell wall binding profiles, which based on structural similarity prediction by BLASTp, can possibly interact with cellular proteins of E. coli such as the transcriptional repressor ulaR, and the ankyrins repeat proteins. At restricted DO, rARU mRNA was 5-fold higher and the protein expression 27-fold higher compared with unrestricted DO. The report shows a strategy for improved production of C. difficile vaccine candidate in E. coli by using restricted DO growth. This strategy could improve the expression of recombinant proteins from anaerobic origin or those with cell wall binding profiles.',\n",
       " 'Porphyromonas gulae is a major periodontal pathogen in dogs, which can be transmitted to their owners. A major virulence factor of P. gulae consists of a 41-kDa filamentous appendage (FimA) on the cell surface, which is classified into three genotypes: A, B, and C. Thus far, inhibition of periodontal disease in dogs remains difficult. The present study assessed the inhibitory effects of a combination of clindamycin and interferon alpha (IFN-Î±) formulation against P. gulae and periodontal disease. Growth of P. gulae was significantly inhibited by clindamycin; this inhibition had a greater effect on type C P. gulae than on type A and B isolates. In contrast, the IFN-Î± formulation inhibited the expression of IL-1Î² and COX-2 elicited by type A and B isolates, but not that elicited by type C isolates. Furthermore, periodontal recovery was promoted by the administration of both clindamycin and IFN-Î± formulation to dogs undergoing periodontal treatment; moreover, this combined treatment reduced the number of FimA genotypes in oral specimens from treated dogs. These results suggest that a combination of clindamycin and IFN-Î± formulation inhibit P. gulae virulence and thus may be effective for the prevention of periodontal disease induced by P. gulae.',\n",
       " 'Influenza-related severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are severe threats to human health. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of systematic corticosteroid therapy in patients with pneumonia or ARDS. The PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and SCOPUS databases were searched up to July, 2019. Nineteen studies including 6637 individuals were identified, and fifteen studies (6427 patients) were included in the meta-analysis of mortality. Eighteen were observational studies and one was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The meta-analysis results showed that corticosteroid therapy was associated with significantly higher mortality (OR 1.53, 95% CI [1.16, 2.01]) and incidence of nosocomial infection (OR 3.15, 95% CI [1.54, 6.45]). Subgroup analysis showed that among patients with unadjusted estimates, the odds of mortality were higher in patients receiving corticosteroid treatment (OR 1.98, 95% CI [1.23, 3.17]), however, among patients with adjusted estimates, the result showed no statistically significant difference between corticosteroid group and control group (OR 1.31, 95% CI [0.95, 1.80]). Current data do not support the routine use of corticosteroids in patients with influenza severe pneumonia or ARDS. RCTs are needed to provide more robust evidence.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: In malaria-endemic areas, human populations are frequently exposed to immunomodulatory salivary components injected during mosquito blood feeding. The consequences on pathogen-specific immune responses are not well known. This study evaluated and compared the humoral responses specific to merozoite stage vaccine candidates of Plasmodium falciparum, in children differentially exposed to Anopheles bites in a natural setting. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was carried out in BouakÃ© (CÃ´te dâ\\x80\\x99Ivoire) where entomological data and blood samples from children (0â\\x80\\x9314 years) were collected in two sites with similar malaria prevalence. Antibody (IgG, IgG1, IgG3) responses to PfAMA1 and PfMSP1 were evaluated by ELISA. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to assess the relationship between the immune responses to P. falciparum antigens and exposure to Anopheles bites in the total cohort and in each site, separately. The individual level of exposure to Anopheles bites was evaluated by quantifying specific IgG response to the Anopheles gSG6-P1 salivary peptide, which represents a proxy of Anopheles exposure. RESULTS: The anti-Plasmodium humoral responses were different according to the level of exposure of children, with those highly exposed to Anopheles presenting significantly lower antibody responses to PfMSP1 in total population (IgG and IgG3) and in Petessou village (IgG, IgG1, IgG3). No significant difference was seen for PfAMA1 antigen between children differently exposed to Anopheles. In Dar-es-Salam, a neighbourhood where a high Culex density was reported, children presented very low antibody levels specific to both antigens, and no difference according to the exposure to Anopheles bites was found. CONCLUSION: These findings may suggest that immunomodulatory components of Anopheles saliva, in addition to other factors, may participate to the modulation of the humoral response specific to Plasmodium merozoite stage antigens. This epidemiological observation may form a starting point for additional work to decipher the role of mosquito saliva on the modulation of the anti-Plasmodium acquired immunity and clinical protection in combining both field and ex vivo immunological studies.',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVES: The requirement of prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) is associated with increased medical care demand and expenses, high early and long-term mortality, and worse life quality. However, no study has assessed the prognostic factors associated with 1-year mortality among PMV patients, not less than 21 days after surgery. This study analyzed the predictors of 1-year mortality in patients requiring PMV in intensive care units (ICUs) after surgery. METHODS: In this multicenter, respective cohort study, 124 patients who required PMV after surgery in the ICUs of five tertiary hospitals in Beijing between January 2007 and June 2016 were enrolled. The primary outcome was the duration of survival within 1 year. Predictors of 1-year mortality were identified with a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. The predictive effect of the ProVent score was also validated. RESULTS: Of the 124 patients enrolled, the cumulative 1-year mortality was 74.2% (92/124). From the multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis, cancer diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 2.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37â\\x80\\x933.35; P < 0.01), no tracheostomy (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.22â\\x80\\x933.30; P < 0.01), enteral nutrition intolerance (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.19â\\x80\\x932.97; P = 0.01), blood platelet count â\\x89¤150 Ã\\x97 10(9)/L (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.14â\\x80\\x932.75; P = 0.01), requirement of vasopressors (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.13â\\x80\\x932.80; P = 0.02), and renal replacement therapy (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01â\\x80\\x932.91; P = 0.047) on the 21st day of mechanical ventilation (MV) were associated with shortened 1-year survival.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Real-time bedside information on regional ventilation and perfusion during mechanical ventilation (MV) may help to elucidate the physiological and pathophysiological effects of MV settings in healthy and injured lungs. We aimed to study the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal volume (V(T)) on the distributions of regional ventilation and perfusion by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in healthy and injured lungs. METHODS: One-hit acute lung injury model was established in 6 piglets by repeated lung lavages (injured group). Four ventilated piglets served as the control group. A randomized sequence of any possible combination of three V(T) (7, 10, and 15 ml/kg) and four levels of PEEP (5, 8, 10, and 12 cmH(2)O) was performed in all animals. Ventilation and perfusion distributions were computed by EIT within three regions-of-interest (ROIs): nondependent, middle, dependent. A mixed design with one between-subjects factor (group: intervention or control), and two within-subjects factors (PEEP and V(T)) was used, with a three-way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Two-way interactions between PEEP and group, and V(T) and group, were observed for the dependent ROI (p = 0.035 and 0.012, respectively), indicating that the increase in the dependent ROI ventilation was greater at higher PEEP and V(T) in the injured group than in the control group. A two-way interaction between PEEP and V(T) was observed for perfusion distribution in each ROI: nondependent (p = 0.030), middle (p = 0.006), and dependent (p = 0.001); no interaction was observed between injured and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Large PEEP and V(T) levels were associated with greater pulmonary ventilation of the dependent lung region in experimental lung injury, whereas they affected pulmonary perfusion of all lung regions both in the control and in the experimental lung injury groups.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Several studies have assessed predictors of weaning and extubation outcome in short-term mechanically ventilated patients, but there are only few studies on predictors of weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Retrospective, single-center, observational study at a specialized national weaning center in Germany. Patientsâ\\x80\\x99 medical records were reviewed to obtain data on demographics, comorbidities, respiratory indices, and the result of a prospectively documented, standardized spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) upon admission to the weaning center. Respiratory indices assessed were the ventilatory ratio (VR) and parameters derived from calculated mechanical power (MP). Predictors associated with failure of prolonged weaning and failure of the SBT were assessed using a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 263 prolonged mechanically ventilated, tracheotomized patients, treated over a 5-year period were analyzed. After 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation, patients with unsuccessful weaning failed a SBT more frequently and showed significantly increased values for inspiratory positive airway pressure, driving pressure, VR, absolute MP, and MP normalized to predicted body weight and dynamic lung-thorax compliance (LTC-MP). In the logistic regression analyses, variables independently correlated with weaning failure were female gender (adjusted odds ratio 0.532 [95% CI 0.291â\\x80\\x930.973]; p = 0.040), obesity (body mass index â\\x89¥ 30 kg/m(2)) (2.595 [1.210â\\x80\\x935.562]; p = 0.014), COPD (3.209 [1.563â\\x80\\x936.589]; p = 0.002), LTC-MP (3.470 [1.067â\\x80\\x9311.284]; p = 0.039), P(a)CO(2) on mechanical ventilation (1.101 [95% CI 1.034â\\x80\\x931.173]; p = 0.003), and failure of the SBT (4.702 [2.250â\\x80\\x939.825]; p < 0.001). In addition, female gender (0.401 [0.216â\\x80\\x930.745]; p = 0.004), LTC-MP (3.017 [1.027â\\x80\\x938.862]; p = 0.046), and P(a)CO(2) on mechanical ventilation (1.157 [1.083â\\x80\\x931.235]; p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for an unsuccessful SBT. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the derived predictors of weaning point to a crucial role of the workload imposed on respiratory muscles during spontaneous breathing. Mechanical power normalized to lung-thorax compliance was independently correlated with weaning outcome and may identify patients at high risk for weaning failure.',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: In septic patients, multiple retrospective studies show an association between large volumes of fluids administered in the first 24 h and mortality, suggesting a benefit to fluid restrictive strategies. However, these studies do not directly estimate the causal effects of fluid-restrictive strategies, nor do their analyses properly adjust for time-varying confounding by indication. In this study, we used causal inference techniques to estimate mortality outcomes that would result from imposing a range of arbitrary limits (â\\x80\\x9ccapsâ\\x80\\x9d) on fluid volume administration during the first 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) care. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: ICUs at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, 2008â\\x80\\x932012 PATIENTS: One thousand six hundred thirty-nine septic patients (defined by Sepsis-3 criteria) 18 years and older, admitted to the ICU from the emergency department (ED), who received less than 4 L fluids administered prior to ICU admission MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). We employed a dynamic Marginal Structural Model fit by inverse probability of treatment weighting to obtain confounding adjusted estimates of mortality rates that would have been observed had fluid resuscitation volume caps between 4 Lâ\\x80\\x9312 L been imposed on the population. The 30-day mortality in our cohort was 17%. We estimated that caps between 6 and 10 L on 24 h fluid volume would have reduced 30-day mortality by â\\x88\\x92 0.6 to â\\x88\\x92 1.0%, with the greatest reduction at 8 L (â\\x88\\x92 1.0% mortality, 95% CI [â\\x88\\x92 1.6%, â\\x88\\x92 0.3%]). CONCLUSIONS: We found that 30-day mortality would have likely decreased relative to observed mortality under current practice if these patients had been subject to â\\x80\\x9ccapsâ\\x80\\x9d on the total volume of fluid administered between 6 and 10 L, with the greatest reduction in mortality rate at 8 L.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Even though enterococci can cause serious infections in multiple sites, they are a rare cause of pneumonia. We reported a uremic patient with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE-fm) pneumonia, possibly related to epileptic seizures. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year old man with uremia on hemodialysis was admitted to the hospital with complaint of recurrent epileptic seizures, followed by a two-week history of recurrent fever and cough with purulent sputum. Chest CT demonstrated multiple exudation of both lungs. He was diagnosed as community acquired pneumonia. Despite antibiotic combination therapy, abnormal chest shadows aggravated. Sputum and blood cultures were initially negative, but later blood culture grew VRE-fm. We suspected aspiration of gastrointestinal content induced by epilepsy as the most likely mechanism. The patient was successfully treated with a four-week course of linezolid according to the antibiotic susceptibility testing. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should consider multi-drug resistant organisms such as VRE in uremic patients with pneumonia that fails to resolve with broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially in the cases with aspiration induced by epilepsy, immunocompromised conditions, and repeated or prolonged hospitalizations.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Identifying immunogens that induce HIV-1-specific immune responses is a lengthy process that can benefit from computational methods, which predict T-cell epitopes for various HLA types. METHODS: We tested the performance of the NetMHCpan4.0 computational neural network in re-identifying 93 T-cell epitopes that had been previously independently mapped using the whole proteome IFN-Î³ ELISPOT assays in 6 HLA class I typed Ugandan individuals infected with HIV-1 subtypes A1 and D. To provide a benchmark we compared the predictions for NetMHCpan4.0 to MHCflurry1.2.0 and NetCTL1.2. RESULTS: NetMHCpan4.0 performed best correctly predicting 88 of the 93 experimentally mapped epitopes for a set length of 9-mer and matched HLA class I alleles. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis gave an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.928. Setting NetMHCpan4.0 to predict 11-14mer length did not improve the prediction (37â\\x80\\x9379 of 93 peptides) with an inverse correlation between the number of predictions and length set. Late time point peptides were significantly stronger binders than early peptides (Wilcoxon signed rank test: p = 0.0000005). MHCflurry1.2.0 similarly predicted all but 2 of the peptides that NetMHCpan4.0 predicted and NetCTL1.2 predicted only 14 of the 93 experimental peptides. CONCLUSION: NetMHCpan4.0 class I epitope predictions covered 95% of the epitope responses identified in six HIV-1 infected individuals, and would have reduced the number of experimental confirmatory tests by > 80%. Algorithmic epitope prediction in conjunction with HLA allele frequency information can cost-effectively assist immunogen design through minimizing the experimental effort.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Available data on antibiotic resistance in sub-Saharan Africa is limited despite its increasing threat to global public health. As there is no previous study on antibiotic resistance in patients with clinical features of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in Sierra Leone, research is needed to inform public health policies. Our study aimed to assess antibiotic resistance rates from isolates in the urine and sputum samples of patients with clinical features of HAIs.

RESULTS: Over the course of the study, we enrolled 164 patients. Risk factors for HAIs were previous antibiotic use (93.3%), comorbidities (58.5%) and age (â\\x89¥65 years) (23.9%). Of the 164 samples, 89.6% were urine. Bacterial growth was recorded in 58.8% of cultured specimens; the type of specimen was an independent predictor of bacterial growth (p < 0.021). The most common isolates were Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae; 29.2% and 19.0% in urine samples and 18.8% and 31.3% in sputum samples, respectively. The overall resistance rates were 58% for all extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms, 13.4% for carbapenem-resistant non-lactose fermenting gram-negative bacilli, 8.7% for carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and 1.3% for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). There were no carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) isolates but all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a high prevalence rate of ESBL-producing organisms which are a significant burden at the main tertiary hospital in Sierra Leone. Urgent action is needed to strengthen microbiological diagnostic infrastructure, initiate surveillance on antibiotic resistance and develop and implement policy framework on antibiotic stewardship.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infection (RTI) in young children is a leading cause of morbidity and hospitalization worldwide. There are few studies assessing the performance for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) versus oropharyngeal swab (OPS) specimens in microbiological findings for children with RTI. The primary purpose of this study was to compare the detection rates of OPS and paired BALF in detecting key respiratory pathogens using suspension microarray. METHODS: We collected paired OPS and BALF specimens from 76 hospitalized children with respiratory illness. The samples were tested simultaneously for 8 respiratory viruses and 5 bacteria by suspension microarray. RESULTS: Of 76 paired specimens, 62 patients (81.6%) had at least one pathogen. BALF and OPS identified respiratory pathogen infections in 57 (75%) and 49 (64.5%) patients, respectively (P > 0.05). The etiology analysis revealed that viruses were responsible for 53.7% of the patients, whereas bacteria accounted for 32.9% and Mycoplasma pneumoniae for 13.4%. The leading 5 pathogens identified were respiratory syncytial virus, Streptococcus pneumoniaee, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and adenovirus, and they accounted for 74.2% of etiological fraction. For detection of any pathogen, the overall detection rate of BALF (81%) was marginally higher than that (69%) of OPS (p = 0.046). The differences in the frequency distribution and sensitivity for most pathogens detected by two sampling methods were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, BALF and OPS had similar microbiological yields. Our results indicated the clinical value of OPS testing in pediatric patients with respiratory illness.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) is an important complication of cardiac surgery. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The incidence of LCOS after surgery is high in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Therefore, determining the risk factors of LCOS has clinical significance for the management of CHD. This study aimed to analyze the risk factors of LCOS. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of children with CHD who underwent cardiac surgery at Shanghai Childrenâ\\x80\\x99s Medical Center between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2017. Demographic characteristics and baseline data were extracted from the health data resource center of the hospital, which integrates clinical routine data including medical records, diagnoses, orders, surgeries, laboratory tests, imaging, nursing, and other subsystems. Logistic regressions were performed to analyze the risk factors of LCOS. RESULTS: Overall, 8660 infants with CHD were included, and 864 (9.98%) had LCOS after surgery. The multivariate regression analysis identified that age (OR 0.992, 95% CI: 0.988â\\x80\\x930.997, p = 0.001), tricuspid regurgitation (1.192, 1.072â\\x80\\x931.326, p = 0.001), Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 risk grade (1.166, 1.011â\\x80\\x931.345, p = 0.035), aortic shunt (left-to-right: 1.37, 1.005â\\x80\\x931.867, p = 0.046; bi-directional: 1.716, 1.138â\\x80\\x932.587, p = 0.01), atrial shunt (left-to-right: 1.407, 1.097â\\x80\\x931.805, p = 0.007; right-to-left: 3.168, 1.944â\\x80\\x935.163, p < 0.001; bi-directional: 1.87, 1.389â\\x80\\x932.519, p < 0.001), ventricular level shunt (left-to-right: 0.676, 0.486â\\x80\\x930.94, p = 0.02; bi-directional: 2.09, 1.611â\\x80\\x932.712, p < 0.001), residual shunt (3.489, 1.502â\\x80\\x938.105, p = 0.004), left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (3.934, 1.673â\\x80\\x939.254, p = 0.002), right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (3.638, 1.225â\\x80\\x9310.798, p = 0.02), circulating temperature (mild hypothermia: 1.526, 95% CI: 1.205â\\x80\\x931.934, p < 0.001; middle and low temperature: 1.738, 1.236â\\x80\\x932.443, p = 0.001), duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (1.009, 1.006â\\x80\\x931.012, p < 0.001), myocardial preservation using histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (1.677, 1.298â\\x80\\x932.167, p < 0.001), and mitral insufficiency (1.714, 1.239â\\x80\\x932.37, p < 0.001) were independent risk predictors of LCOS. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of postoperative LCOS in CHD children remains high. Circulation temperature, myocardial preservation using histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate, and usage of residual shunt after surgery were independent risk predictors for LCOS.',\n",
       " 'Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza virus is a multifunctional protein that plays an important role in virus replication and virulence. In this study, an acetylation modification was identified at the K108 residue of the NS1 protein of H1N1 influenza virus. To further explore the function of the K108 acetylation modification of the NS1 protein, a deacetylation-mimic mutation (K108R) and a constant acetylation-mimic mutation (K108Q) were introduced into the NS1 protein in the background of A/WSN/1933 H1N1 (WSN), resulting in two mutant viruses (WSN-NS1-108R and WSN-NS1-108Q). In vitro and mouse studies showed that the deacetylation-mimic mutation K108R in the NS1 protein attenuated the replication and virulence of WSN-NS1-108R, while the constant acetylation-mimic mutant virus WSN-NS1-108Q showed similar replication and pathogenicity as the wild-type WSN virus (WSN-wt). The results indicated that acetylation at K108 of the NS1 protein has an important role in the replication and virulence of influenza virus. To further explore the potential mechanism, the type I interferon (IFN-I) antagonistic activity of the three NS1 proteins (NS1-108Q, NS1-108R, and NS1-wt) was compared in cells, which showed that the K108R mutation significantly attenuated the IFN-Î² antagonistic activity of the NS1 protein compared with NS1-wt and NS1-108Q. Both NS1-wt and NS1-108Q inhibited the IFN-Î² response activated by RIG-I CARD domain, MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3 more efficiently than the NS1-108R protein in cells. Taken together, the results indicated that acetylation at NS1 K108 is important for the IFN antagonistic activity of the NS1 protein and virulence of the influenza virus.',\n",
       " 'Millions are exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) every year, but not all acquire the virus, suggesting a potential role for host genetics in the moderation of HIV-1 acquisition. Here, we analyzed summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association study of HIV-1 acquisition to-date, consisting of 6,334 infected patients and 7,247 population controls, to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms implicated in this trait. We found that HIV-1 acquisition is polygenic and heritable, with SNP heritability estimates explaining 28â\\x80\\x9342% of the variance in this trait at a population level. Genetic correlations alongside UK Biobank data revealed associations with smoking, prospective memory and socioeconomic traits. Gene-level enrichment analysis identified EF-hand calcium binding domain 14 as a novel susceptibility gene for HIVâ\\x80\\x931 acquisition. We also observed that susceptibility variants for HIV-1 acquisition were significantly enriched for genes expressed in T-cells, but also in striatal and hippocampal neurons. Finally, we tested how polygenic risk scores for HIV-1 acquisition influence blood levels of 35 inflammatory markers in 406 HIV-1-negative individuals. We found that higher genetic risk for HIV-1 acquisition was associated with lower levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 17. Our findings corroborate a complex model for HIV-1 acquisition, whereby susceptibility is partly heritable and moderated by specific behavioral, cellular and immunological parameters.',\n",
       " 'In the absence of a correlate(s) of protection against human tuberculosis and a validated animal model of the disease, tools to facilitate vaccine development must be identified. We present an optimised ex vivo mycobacterial growth inhibition assay (MGIA) to assess the ability of host cells within the lung to inhibit mycobacterial growth, including Bacille Calmetteâ\\x80\\x93GuÃ©rin (BCG) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) Erdman. Growth of BCG was reduced by 0.39, 0.96 and 0.73 log(10) CFU following subcutaneous (s.c.) BCG, intranasal (i.n.) BCG, or BCG s.c. + mucosal boost, respectively, versus naÃ¯ve mice. Comparatively, a 0.49 (s.c.), 0.60 (i.n.) and 0.81 (s.c. + mucosal boost) log(10) reduction in MTB CFU was found. A BCG growth inhibitor, 2-thiophenecarboxylic acid hydrazide (TCH), was used to prevent quantification of residual BCG from i.n. immunisation and allow accurate MTB quantification. Using TCH, a further 0.58 log(10) reduction in MTB CFU was revealed in the i.n. group. In combination with existing methods, the ex vivo lung MGIA may represent an important tool for analysis of vaccine efficacy and the immune mechanisms associated with vaccination in the organ primarily affected by MTB disease.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Topical 0.12% chlorhexidine has been used widely to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. However, it is not approved for mucosal application in Japan. The aims of this study were to investigate if topical povidone iodine (i) inhibits bacterial growth and (ii) disrupts the balance of the oral microbiota. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial included 23 patients who underwent mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. The patients were divided randomly into two groups: the intervention group (n = 16) and the control group (n = 7). All patients received oral cleaning with 3% hydrogen peroxide, followed by irrigation with tap water. The patients in the intervention group received 10% povidone iodine applied topically to the oral cavity. The concentration of total bacteria in the oropharyngeal fluid were determined before, immediately after, 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h after oral care using the Rapid Oral Bacteria Quantification System, which is based on dielectrophoresis and impedance measurements. The number of streptococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Candida albicans before, immediately after, 1 h, and 3 h after oral care were estimated based on real-time polymerase chain reaction data. RESULTS: After irrigation of the oral cavity, the number of bacteria decreased, but increased again at 1 h after oral care in the control group; however, in the intervention group, the concentration of bacteria was significantly lower than that in the control group at 1 hour (p = 0.009), 2 h (p = 0.001), and 3 h (p = 0.001) after oral care. The growth of all bacterial species tested was inhibited in the intervention group at 3 h after oral care, suggesting that povidone iodine did not disturb the balance of the oral microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: Topical application of povidone iodine after cleaning and irrigation of the oral cavity inhibited bacterial growth in the oropharyngeal fluid of patients on mechanical ventilation while not disrupting the balance of the oral microbiota.

       " 'BACKGROUND: An extreme and persistent dysbiosis occurs among critically ill patients, regardless of the heterogeneity of disease. Dysbiosis in critically ill patients may make them prone to hospital-acquired infections, sepsis, multi-organ failure (MOF), energy homeostasis disturbance, muscle wasting, and cachexia. Modulation of gut microbiota through synbiotics can be considered as a potential treatment for muscle wasting and macronutrient homeostasis disturbances. METHODS: This is a prospective, single-center, double-blind, parallel randomized controlled trial with the aim to evaluate the effects of synbiotic supplementation on energy and macronutrient homeostasis and muscle wasting in critically ill patients. A total of 40 hemodynamically stable, adult, critically ill patients who receive enteral nutrition via a nasogasteric tube (NGT) in the 24â\\x80\\x9348 h after admission to critical care will be included in this study. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive Lactocare (ZistTakhmir) capsules 500 mg every 12 h or a placebo capsule, which contains only the sterile maize starch and is similar to synbiotic capsules for 14 days. The synbiotic and placebo capsules will be given through the nasogastric tube, separately from gavage, after feeding. DISCUSSION: Gut microbiota modulation through synbiotics is proposed to improve clinical prognosis and reduce infectious complications, ventilator dependency, and length of ICU stay by improving energy and macronutrient homeostasis and reducing muscle protein catabolism.

In this narrative review, we first describe the rationale of the individual components of SDD and then review the evidence base for patient-centered outcomes, where we distinguish ICUs with low prevalence of antibiotic resistance from ICUs with moderateâ\\x80\\x93high prevalence of resistance. In settings with low prevalence of antibiotic resistance, SDD has been associated with improved patient outcome in three cluster-randomized studies. These benefits were not confirmed in a large international cluster-randomized study in settings with moderate-to-high prevalence of antibiotic resistance. There is no evidence that SDD increases antibiotic resistance. We end with future directions for research.

       " 'Concerted evolution is often observed in multigene families such as the CEA gene family. As a result, sequence similarity of paralogous genes is significantly higher than expected from their evolutionary distance. Gene conversion, a â\\x80\\x9ccopy pasteâ\\x80\\x9d DNA repair mechanism that transfers sequences from one gene to another and homologous recombination are drivers of concerted evolution. Nevertheless, some gene family members escape concerted evolution and acquire sufficient sequence differences that orthologous genes can be assigned in descendant species. Reasons why some gene family members can escape while others are captured by concerted evolution are poorly understood. By analyzing the entire CEA gene family in cattle (Bos taurus) we identified a member (CEACAM32) that was created by gene duplication and cooption of a unique transmembrane domain exon in the most recent ancestor of ruminants. CEACAM32 shows a unique, testis-specific expression pattern. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CEACAM32 is not involved in concerted evolution of CEACAM1 paralogs in ruminants. However, analysis of gene conversion events revealed that CEACAM32 is subject to gene conversion but remarkably, these events are found in the leader exon and intron sequences but not in exons coding for the Ig-like domains. These findings suggest that natural selection hinders gene conversion affecting protein sequences of the mature protein and thereby support escape of CEACAM32 from concerted evolution.',\n",
       " 'Renin angiotensin system (RAS) is an endocrine system widely known for its physiological roles in electrolyte homeostasis, body fluid volume regulation and cardiovascular control in peripheral circulation. However, brain RAS is an independent form of RAS expressed locally in the brain, which is known to be involved in brain functions and disorders. There is strong evidence for a major involvement of excessive brain angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)/Angiotensin II (Ang II)/Angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT-1R) axis in increased activation of oxidative stress, apoptosis and neuroinflammation causing neurodegeneration in several brain disorders. Numerous studies have demonstrated strong neuroprotective effects by blocking AT1R in these brain disorders. Additionally, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/Angiotensin (1â\\x80\\x937)/Mas receptor (MASR), is another axis of brain RAS which counteracts the damaging effects of ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis on neurons in the brain. Thus, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and activation of ACE2/Angiotensin (1â\\x80\\x937)/MASR axis may serve as an exciting and novel method for neuroprotection in several neurodegenerative diseases. Here in this review article, we discuss the expression of RAS in the brain and highlight how altered RAS level may cause neurodegeneration. Understanding the pathophysiology of RAS and their links to neurodegeneration has enormous potential to identify potentially effective pharmacological tools to treat neurodegenerative diseases in the brain.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Hospice workers are required to regularly use emotional regulation strategies in an attempt to encourage and sustain terminally ill patients and families. Daily emotional regulation in reaction to constantly watching suffering patients may be intensified among those hospice professionals who have high levels of compassion fatigue. The main object of this study was to examine the relationship between daily exposition to seeing patient suffering and daily emotional work, and to assess whether compassion fatigue (secondary traumatic stress and burnout) buffers this relationship. METHODS: We used a diary research design for collecting daily fluctuations in seeing patients suffering and emotional work display. Participants filled in a general survey and daily survey over a period of eight consecutive workdays. A total of 39 hospice professionals from two Italian hospices participated in the study. RESULTS: Multilevel analyses demonstrated that daily fluctuations in seeing patients suffering was positively related to daily emotional work display after controlling for daily death of patients. Moreover, considering previous levels of compassion fatigue, a buffering effect of high burnout on seeing patients suffering - daily emotional work display relationship was found. CONCLUSIONS: A central finding of our study is that fluctuations in daily witness of patients suffering are positively related to daily use of positive emotional regulations. Further, our results show that burnout buffers this relationship such that hospice professionals with high burnout use more emotional display in days where they recurrently witness patients suffering.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is a highly invasive bacterium that infects the human intestinal mucosa and causes ~ 11.9â\\x80\\x9320.6 million infections and ~ 130,000â\\x80\\x93223,000 deaths annually worldwide. Oral typhoid vaccine Ty21a confers a moderate level of long-lived protection (5â\\x80\\x937 years) in the field. New and improved vaccines against enteric pathogens are needed but their development is hindered by a lack of the immunological correlates of protection especially at the site of infection. Tissue resident memory T (T(RM)) cells provide immediate adaptive effector immune responsiveness at the infection site. However, the mechanism(s) by which S. Typhi induces T(RM) in the intestinal mucosa are unknown. Here, we focus on the induction of S. Typhi-specific CD4+T(RM) subsets by Ty21a in the human terminal ileum lamina propria and epithelial compartments. METHODS: Terminal ileum biopsies were obtained from consenting volunteers undergoing routine colonoscopy who were either immunized orally with 4 doses of Ty21a or not. Isolated lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) CD4+T(RM) immune responses were determined using either S. Typhi-infected or non-infected autologous EBV-B cell lines as stimulator cells. T-CMI was assessed by the production of 4 cytokines [interferon (IFN)Î³, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-17A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)Î±] in 36 volunteers (18 vaccinees and 18 controls volunteers). RESULTS: Although the frequencies of LPMC CD103+ CD4+T(RM) were significant decreased, both CD103+ and CD103â\\x88\\x92 CD4+T(RM) subsets spontaneously produced significantly higher levels of cytokines (IFNÎ³ and IL-17A) following Ty21a-immunization. Importantly, we observed significant increases in S. Typhi-specific LPMC CD103+ CD4+T(RM) (IFNÎ³ and IL-17A) and CD103â\\x88\\x92 CD4+T(RM) (IL-2 and IL-17A) responses following Ty21a-immunization. Further, differences in S. Typhi-specific responses between these two CD4+T(RM) subsets were observed following multifunctional analysis. In addition, we determined the effect of Ty21a-immunization on IEL and observed significant changes in the frequencies of IEL CD103+ (decrease) and CD103â\\x88\\x92 CD4+T(RM) (increase) following immunization. Finally, we observed that IEL CD103â\\x88\\x92 CD4+T(RM), but not CD103+ CD4+T(RM), produced increased cytokines (IFNÎ³, TNFÎ± and IL-17A) to S. Typhi-specific stimulation following Ty21a-immunization. CONCLUSIONS: Oral Ty21a-immunization elicits distinct compartment specific immune responses in CD4+T(RM) (CD103+ and CD103â\\x88\\x92) subsets.

       " 'Tissue-resident memory T cells (T(RM) cells) are critical for cellular immunity to respiratory pathogens and reside in both the airways and the interstitium. In the present study, we found that the airway environment drove transcriptional and epigenetic changes that specifically regulated the cytolytic functions of airway T(RM) cells and promoted apoptosis due to amino acid starvation and activation of the integrated stress response. Comparison of airway T(RM) cells and splenic effector-memory T cells transferred into the airways indicated that the environment was necessary to activate these pathways, but did not induce T(RM) cell lineage reprogramming. Importantly, activation of the integrated stress response was reversed in airway T(RM) cells placed in a nutrient-rich environment. Our data defined the genetic programs of distinct lung T(RM) cell populations and show that local environmental cues altered airway T(RM) cells to limit cytolytic function and promote cell death, which ultimately leads to fewer T(RM) cells in the lung.',\n",

Here we show that the B38-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Paenibacillus sp. B38, is an ACE2-like enzyme to decrease angiotensin II levels in mice. In protein 3D structure analysis, B38-CAP homolog shares structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 with low sequence identity. In vitro, recombinant B38-CAP protein catalyzed the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1â\\x80\\x937, as well as other known ACE2 target peptides. Treatment with B38-CAP suppressed angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis in mice.

Our data identify the bacterial B38-CAP as an ACE2-like carboxypeptidase, indicating that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase to a human ACE2-like enzyme. Bacterial engineering could be utilized to design improved protein drugs for hypertension and heart failure.',\n",
       " 'Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) develops due to the narrowing or blockage of arteries supplying blood to the lower limbs. Surgical and endovascular interventions are the main treatments for advanced PAD but alternative and adjunctive medical therapies are needed. Currently the main preclinical experimental model employed in PAD research is based on induction of acute hind limb ischemia (HLI) by a 1-stage procedure. Since there are concerns regarding the ability to translate findings from this animal model to patients, we aimed to develop a novel clinically relevant animal model of PAD. HLI was induced in male Apolipoprotein E (ApoE(â\\x88\\x92/â\\x88\\x92)) deficient mice by a 2-stage procedure of initial gradual femoral artery occlusion by ameroid constrictors for 14 days and subsequent excision of the femoral artery. This 2-stage HLI model was compared to the classical 1-stage HLI model and sham controls. Ischemia severity was assessed using Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging (LDPI). Ambulatory ability was assessed using an open field test, a treadmill test and using established scoring scales. Molecular markers of angiogenesis and shear stress were assessed within gastrocnemius muscle tissue samples using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. HLI was more severe in mice receiving the 2-stage compared to the 1-stage ischemia induction procedure as assessed by LDPI (p = 0.014), and reflected in a higher ischemic score (p = 0.004) and lower average distance travelled on a treadmill test (p = 0.045). Mice undergoing the 2-stage HLI also had lower expression of angiogenesis markers (vascular endothelial growth factor, p = 0.004; vascular endothelial growth factor- receptor 2, p = 0.008) and shear stress response mechano-transducer transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (p = 0.041) within gastrocnemius muscle samples, compared to animals having the 1-stage HLI procedure. Mice subjected to the 2-stage HLI receiving an exercise program showed significantly greater improvement in their ambulatory ability on a treadmill test than a sedentary control group. This study describes a novel model of HLI which leads to more severe and sustained ischemia than the conventionally used model. Exercise therapy, which has established efficacy in PAD patients, was also effective in this new model. This new model maybe useful in the evaluation of potential novel PAD therapies.',\n",

In this study, we characterised the HIV-1 molecular epidemiology by analysing 1442 HIV-1 pol sequences collected 1999â\\x80\\x932014 from four geopolitical zones in Nigeria using state-of-the-art maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. The main circulating forms were the circulating recombinant form (CRF) 02_AG (44% of the analysed sequences), CRF43_02G (16%), and subtype G (8%). Twenty-three percent of the sequences represented unique recombinant forms (URFs), whereof 37 (11%) could be grouped into seven potentially novel CRFs. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis suggested that five major Nigerian HIV-1 sub-epidemics were introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, close to the Nigerian Civil War. The analysis also indicated that the number of effective infections decreased in Nigeria after the introduction of free antiretroviral treatment in 2006. Finally, Bayesian phylogeographic analysis suggested gravity-like dynamics in which virus lineages first emerge and expand within large urban centers such as Abuja and Lagos, before migrating towards smaller rural areas.

Partial protection was achieved with the lower PIZV doses of 0.016 Âµg and 0.08 Âµg. Based on these data, a neutralizing antibody response above 3.02 log(10) EC50 was determined as a correlate of protection in macaques. PIZV elicited a dose-dependent neutralizing antibody response which is protective for at least 1 year following vaccination.',\n",
       " 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) is the commonest diagnosis after premature birth. We aimed to audit clinical practices before and after introduction of a national guideline in Wales on RDS management. Anonymised, prospective data on all infants born at <34 weeks of gestation and cared for at one of the participating neonatal units in Wales were collected in two six-month time periods in 2015 and 2018. A national guideline was introduced in 2016 by the Wales Neonatal Network. Data collection included areas of antenatal management, delivery room stabilisation, invasive and non-invasive respiratory support, surfactant treatment and elements of supportive care. Univariate and multivariate methods were used to compare data between the two epochs. Comparing care before and after introduction of the national guideline, areas of significant improvement include use of targeted tidal volume ventilation, use of caffeine therapy, oxygen therapy post-surfactant and increasing early use of parenteral nutrition. Areas of poorer management included levels of positive end expiratory pressures and timing of introduction of enteral feeds. Little variation was seen between level two and three units, although gestational age was a significant independent variable for several practices, including delayed cord clamping, stabilisation with intubation, early enteral feeding and caffeine administration. A national guideline for management of RDS in Wales has significantly improved practice in several areas. However, despite a large volume of high-quality evidence and robust guidance, there remains a significant variation in some elements of best practice for RDS management. Further work should focus on education and training, especially for elements requiring cross-departmental work.',\n",
       " 'We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the clinical efficacy of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy as apneic oxygenation in critically ill patients who require endotracheal intubation in the intensive care unit (ICU). This systematic review and meta-analysis included six randomized controlled trials and a prospective study identified in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science until August 18, 2019. In this meta-analysis including 956 participants, HFNC was noninferior to standard of care during endotracheal intubation regarding incidence of severe hypoxemia, mean lowest oxygen saturation, and in-hospital mortality. HFNC significantly shortened the ICU stay by a mean of 1.8 days. In linear meta-regression interaction analysis, the risk ratio of severe hypoxemia decreased with increasing baseline partial oxygen pressure (PaO(2)) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) ratio. In subgroup analysis, HFNC significantly reduced the incidence of severe hypoxemia during endotracheal intubation in patients with mild hypoxemia (PaO(2)/FiO(2)> 200 mmHg; risk difference, â\\x88\\x920.06; 95% confidence interval, â\\x88\\x920.12 to â\\x88\\x920.01; number needed to treat = 16.7). In conclusion, HFNC was noninferior to standard of care for oxygen delivery during endotracheal intubation and was associated with a significantly shorter ICU stay. The beneficial effect of HFNC in reducing the incidence of severe hypoxemia was observed in patients with mild hypoxemia.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Mosquito-borne viral infections have in recent years, become a public health threat globally. This review aimed to provide an overview of the ecological and epidemiological profiles of mosquito-borne viral infections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). METHODS: A search of literature was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed and the WHO website using the following keywords: â\\x80\\x9cDemocratic Republic of the Congoâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cZaireâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cBelgian Congoâ\\x80\\x9d and either of the following: â\\x80\\x9cmosquito-borne virusâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9carbovirusâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cyellow feverâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cdengueâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cchikungunyaâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cWest Nileâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cRift Valley feverâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cOâ\\x80\\x99nyongâ\\x80\\x99nyongâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cZikaâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cepidemiologyâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cecologyâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cmorbidityâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cmortalityâ\\x80\\x9d. Published articles in English or French covering a period between 1912 and October 2018 were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 37 articles were included in the review. The findings indicate that the burden of mosquito-borne viral infections in DRC is increasing over time and space. The north-western, north-eastern, western and central regions have the highest burden of mosquito-borne viral infections compared to south and eastern highland regions. Yellow fever, chikungunya, dengue, Zika, Rift Valley fever, West Nile and Oâ\\x80\\x99nyongâ\\x80\\x99nyong have been reported in the country. These mosquito-borne viruses were found circulating in human, wildlife and domestic animals. Yellow fever and chikungunya outbreaks have been frequently reported. Aedes aegypti and Ae. simpsoni were documented as the main vectors of most of the mosquito-borne viral infections. Heavy rains, human movements, forest encroachment and deforestation were identified as drivers of mosquito-borne viruses occurrence in DRC. CONCLUSIONS: Mosquito-borne viral infections are becoming common and a serious public health problem in DRC. In the current context of climate change, there is urgent need to improve understanding on ecological and epidemiology of the diseases and strengthen surveillance systems for prompt response to epidemics in DRC.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The effect of alternative spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) techniques on extubation success and other clinically important outcomes is uncertain. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to clarify the preferable SBT (T-piece or pressure support ventilation [PSV]). METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to the 31st of July 2019. We included RCTs involving adult patients (> 18 years) who underwent at least two different SBT methods. All authors reported our primary outcome of successful extubation rate and clearly compared PS versus T-piece with clinically relevant secondary outcomes (rate of reintubation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and ICU and hospital mortality). Results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) with accompanying 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Ten RCTs including 3165 patients were included. The results of this meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the successful extubation rate between the T-piece group and PS group (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.78â\\x80\\x931.07; P = 0.27; I(2) = 79%). In addition, compared with the PS group, the T-piece group showed no significant difference in the rate of reintubation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.78â\\x80\\x931.26; P = 0.95; I(2) = 5%), ICU mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.83â\\x80\\x931.80; P = 0.30; I(2) = 0%), hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36; 95% CI, 0.99â\\x80\\x931.87; P = 0.06; I(2) = 19%), ICU length of stay (mean difference = â\\x88\\x92 0.10; 95% CI, â\\x88\\x92 0.59 to 0.39; P = 0.69; I(2) = 13%), and hospital length of stay (mean difference = â\\x88\\x92 0.82;95% CI, â\\x88\\x92 2.2 to 0.55; P = 0.24; I(2) = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: T-piece and PSV as SBTs are considered to have comparable predictive power of successful extubation in critically ill patients. The analysis of secondary outcomes also shows no significant difference in the rate of reintubation, ICU and hospital length of stay, and ICU and hospital mortality between the two groups. Further randomized controlled studies of SBTs are still required.',\n",
       " 'The belief that, for the individual patient, the benefit of prompt and continued use of antimicrobials outweighs any potential harm is a significant barrier to improved stewardship of these vital agents. Antimicrobial stewardship may be perceived as utilitarian rationing, seeking to preserve the availability of effective antimicrobials by limiting the development of resistance in a manner which could conflict with the immediate treatment of the patient in need. This view does not account for the growing evidence of antimicrobial-associated harm to individual patients. This review sets out the evidence for antimicrobial-associated harm and how this should be balanced with the need for prompt and appropriate therapy in infection. It describes the mechanisms by which antimicrobials may harm patients including: mitochondrial toxicity; immune cell toxicity; adverse drug reactions; selection of resistant organisms within a given patient; and disruption of the microbiome. Finally, the article indicates how the harms of antimicrobials may be mitigated and identifies areas for research and development in this field.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid treatment has been widely used in the treatment of septic shock, influenza, and ARDS, although some previous studies discourage its use in severe influenza patients. This multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted in the intensive care units (ICUs) of eight medical centers across Taiwan aims to determine the real-world status of corticosteroid treatment in patients with influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and its impact on clinical outcomes. Between October 2015 and March 2016, consecutive ICU patients with virology-proven influenza infections who fulfilled ARDS and received invasive mechanical ventilation were enrolled. The impact of early corticosteroid treatment (â\\x89¥ 200 mg hydrocortisone equivalent dose within 3 days after ICU admission, determined by a sensitivity analysis) on hospital mortality (the primary outcome) was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis, and further confirmed in a propensity score-matched cohort. RESULTS: Among the 241 patients with influenza-associated ARDS, 85 (35.3%) patients receiving early corticosteroid treatment had similar baseline characteristics, but a significantly higher hospital mortality rate than those without early corticosteroid treatment [43.5% (37/85) vs. 19.2% (30/156), p < 0.001]. Early corticosteroid treatment was independently associated with increased hospital mortality in overall patients [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) = 5.02 (2.39â\\x80\\x9310.54), p < 0.001] and in all subgroups. Earlier treatment and higher dosing were associated with higher hospital mortality. Early corticosteroid treatment was associated with a significantly increased odds of subsequent bacteremia [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) = 2.37 (1.01â\\x80\\x935.56)]. The analyses using a propensity score-matched cohort showed consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: Early corticosteroid treatment was associated with a significantly increased hospital mortality in adult patients with influenza-associated ARDS. Earlier treatment and higher dosing were associated with higher hospital mortality. Clinicians should be cautious while using corticosteroid treatment in this patient group.',\n",
       " 'Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is considered as the primary pathogen of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), which results in significant economic losses worldwide. Clinically, PCV2 often causes disease through coinfection with other bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus suis (S. suis), and especially the highly prevalent S. suis serotype 2 (SS2). The present study determined that continuous PCV2 infection in piglets down-regulates tight junction proteins (TJ) ZO-1 and occludin in the lungs. Swine tracheal epithelial cells (STEC) were used to explore the mechanisms and consequences of disruption of TJ, and an in vitro tracheal epithelial barrier model was established. Our results show that PCV2 infection in STEC decreases the expression levels of ZO-1 and occludin and increases the permeability of the tracheal epithelial barrier, resulting in easier translocation of SS2. Moreover, Western blot analysis indicates that PCV2 infection activates the JNK/MAPK pathway. The disruption of TJ in SETC and increased permeability of the epithelial barrier induced by PCV2 could be alleviated by inhibition of JNK phosphorylation, which indicates that the JNK/MAPK pathway regulates the expression of ZO-1 and occludin during PCV2 infection. This study allows us to better understand the mechanisms of PCV2 coinfection with bacterial pathogens and provides new insight into controlling the occurrence of PCVAD.',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: Administration of diuretics has been shown to assist fluid management and improve clinical outcomes in the critically ill post-shock resolution. Current guidelines have not yet included standardization or guidance for diuretic-based de-resuscitation in critically ill patients. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a multi-disciplinary protocol for diuresis-guided de-resuscitation in the critically ill. METHODS: This was a pre-post single-center pilot study within the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a large academic medical center. Adult patients admitted to the Medical ICU receiving mechanical ventilation with either (1) clinical signs of volume overload via chest radiography or physical exam or (2) any cumulative fluid balance â\\x89¥ 0 mL since hospital admission were eligible for inclusion. Patients received diuresis per clinician discretion for a 2-year period (historical control) followed by a diuresis protocol for 1 year (intervention). Patients within the intervention group were matched in a 1:3 ratio with those from the historical cohort who met the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: A total of 364 patients were included, 91 in the protocol group and 273 receiving standard care. Protocolized diuresis was associated with a significant decrease in 72-h post-shock cumulative fluid balance [median, IQR â\\x88\\x92 2257 (â\\x88\\x92 5676â\\x80\\x93920) mL vs 265 (â\\x88\\x92 2283â\\x80\\x933025) mL; p < 0.0001]. In-hospital mortality in the intervention group was lower compared to the historical group (5.5% vs 16.1%; p = 0.008) and higher ICU-free days (p = 0.03). However, no statistically significant difference was found in ventilator-free days, and increased rates of hypernatremia and hypokalemia were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a protocol for diuresis for de-resuscitation can significantly improve 72-h post-shock fluid balance with potential benefit on clinical outcomes.',\n",
       " 'Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of infections in humans. The emergence of virulent, antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus is a significant public health concern. Most virulence and resistance factors in S. aureus are encoded by mobile genetic elements, and transduction by bacteriophages represents the main mechanism for horizontal gene transfer. The baseplate is a specialized structure at the tip of bacteriophage tails that plays key roles in host recognition, cell wall penetration, and DNA ejection. We have used high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of the S. aureus bacteriophage 80Î± baseplate at 3.75 Ã\\x85 resolution, allowing atomic models to be built for most of the major tail and baseplate proteins, including two tail fibers, the receptor binding protein, and part of the tape measure protein. Our structure provides a structural basis for understanding host recognition, cell wall penetration and DNA ejection in viruses infecting Gram-positive bacteria. Comparison to other phages demonstrates the modular design of baseplate proteins, and the adaptations to the host that take place during the evolution of staphylococci and other pathogens.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Almost all preventable neonatal deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries and affect the poorest who have the least access to high quality health services. Cost of health care is one of the factors preventing access to quality health services and universal health coverage. In Nepal, the majority of expenses related to newborn care are borne by the caregiver, regardless of socioeconomic status. We conducted a study to assess the out of pocket expenditure (OOPE) for sick newborn care in hospitals in Nepal. METHODS: This cross-sectional study of hospital care for newborns was conducted in 11 hospitals in Nepal and explored OOPE incurred by caregivers for sick newborn care. Data were collected from the caregivers of the sick newborn on the topics of cost of travel, accommodation, treatment (drugs, diagnosis) and documented on a sick newborn case record form. RESULTS: Data were collected from 814 caregivers. Cost of caregiversâ\\x80\\x99 stay accounted for more than 40% of the OOPE for sick newborn care, followed by cost of travel, and the babyâ\\x80\\x99s stay and treatment. The overall OOPE ranged from 13.6 to 226.1 US dollars (USD). The median OOPE was highest for preterm complications ($33.2 USD; CI 14.0â\\x80\\x93226.1), followed by hyperbilirubinemia ($31.9 USD; CI 14.0â\\x80\\x9360.7), respiratory distress syndrome ($26.9 USD; 15.3â\\x80\\x93121.5), neonatal sepsis ($ 25.8 USD; CI 13.6â\\x80\\x93139.8) and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ($23.4 USD; CI 13.6â\\x80\\x9397.7). DISCUSSION FOR PRACTICE: In Nepal, OOPE for sick newborn care in hospitals varied by neonatal morbidity and duration of stay. The largest proportion of OOPE were for accommodation and travel. Affordable and accessible health care will substantially reduce the OOPE for sick newborn care in hospitals.',\n",
       " 'Sarcocystis neurona was recognised as an important cause of mortality in southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) after an outbreak in April 2004 and has since been detected in many marine mammal species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Risk of S. neurona exposure in sea otters is associated with consumption of clams and soft-sediment prey and is temporally associated with runoff events. We examined the spatial distribution of S. neurona exposure risk based on serum antibody testing and assessed risk factors for exposure in animals from California, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska. Significant spatial clustering of seropositive animals was observed in California and Washington, compared with British Columbia and Alaska. Adult males were at greatest risk for exposure to S. neurona, and there were strong associations with terrestrial features (wetlands, cropland, high human housing-unit density). In California, habitats containing soft sediment exhibited greater risk than hard substrate or kelp beds. Consuming a diet rich in clams was also associated with increased exposure risk. These findings suggest a transmission pathway analogous to that described for Toxoplasma gondii, with infectious stages traveling in freshwater runoff and being concentrated in particular locations by marine habitat features, ocean physical processes, and invertebrate bioconcentration.',\n",
       " 'Fungal diseases seriously affect agricultural production and the food industry. Crop protection is usually achieved by synthetic fungicides, therefore more sustainable and innovative technologies are increasingly required. The atmospheric pressure low-temperature plasma is a novel suitable measure. We report on the effect of plasma treatment on phytopathogenic fungi causing quantitative and qualitative losses of products both in the field and postharvest. We focus our attention on the in vitro direct inhibitory effect of non-contact Surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge on conidia germination of Botrytis cinerea, Monilinia fructicola, Aspergillus carbonarius and Alternaria alternata. A few minutes of treatment was required to completely inactivate the fungi on an artificial medium. Morphological analysis of spores by Scanning Electron Microscopy suggests that the main mechanism is plasma etching due to Reactive Oxygen Species or UV radiation. Spectroscopic analysis of plasma generated in humid air gives the hint that the rotational temperature of gas should not play a relevant role being very close to room temperature. In vivo experiments on artificially inoculated cherry fruits demonstrated that inactivation of fungal spores by the direct inhibitory effect of plasma extend their shelf life. Pre-treatment of fruits before inoculation improve the resistance to infections maybe by activating defense responses in plant tissues.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Hip osteoarthritis (HOA) is the most common hip disorder and a major cause of disability in the adult population, with an estimated prevalence of end-stage disease and total hip replacement. Thus, the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the early stages of the disease in young adults are crucial to reduce the incidence of end-stage HOA. The purpose of this study was to determine whether (1) a relationship among the inflammatory status of labrum and synovium collected from patients with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) would exist; and (2) to investigate the associations among the histopathological features of joint tissues, the pre-operative symptoms and the post-operative outcomes after arthroscopic surgery. METHODS: Joint tissues from 21 patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for FAI were collected and their histological and immunohistochemical features were correlated with clinical parameters. RESULTS: Synovial mononuclear cell infiltration was observed in 25% of FAI patients, inversely correlated with the hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score (HOOS) pain and function subscales and with the absolute and relative change in total HOOS. All the labral samples showed some pattern of degeneration and 67% of the samples showed calcium deposits. The total labral score was associated with increased CD68 positive cells in the synovium. The presence of labral calcifications, along with the chondral damage worsened the HOOS post-op symptoms (adjusted R-square = 0.76 p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a relationship between the histologic labral features, the synovial inflammation, and the cartilage condition at the time of FAI. The presence of labral calcifications, along with the cartilage damage and the synovitis negatively affects the post-operative outcomes in patients with FAI.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is one of the most serious complications in patients treated with a halo-vest brace. However, the cause of dysphagia development by halo-vest fixation is not yet clear. We therefore investigated the incidence of dysphagia and cervical alignment as well as clinical data from medical charts in patients treated with a halo-vest brace. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from the medical charts of 49 patients who had undergone halo-vest fixation. Occipito (O)-C2 angle, C2-C6 angle, and pharyngeal inlet angle were assessed by lateral plain X-rays of the cervical spine. The impacts of these parameters on incidence and severity of dysphagia were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (32%) suffered from dysphagia during halo-vest fixation, and age and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay were greater in the dysphagia group (p = 0.044 and 0.013, respectively) than in those who did not develop dysphagia. O-C2 angle was smaller in the dysphagia group (p = 0.016). After multivariate logistic analysis, body mass index, ICU stay, and O-C2 angle remained as independent risk factors related to incidence of dysphagia. Spearman rank correlation showed a negative correlation between ICU stay and Food Intake Level Scale (FILS) (p = 0.026), and a positive correlation between O-C2 angle and FILS (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: This study suggested that O-C2 angle is related to both incidence and severity of dysphagia due to halo-vest fixation.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Among all cases of nosocomial pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus is the second most prevalent pathogen (17.8%). In Europe, 29.9% of the isolates are oxacillin-resistant. The changing epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nosocomial infections and the decreasing susceptibility to first-line antibiotics leave clinicians with few therapeutic options. The objective of our study was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility, the associated molecular mechanisms of resistance and the epidemiological relatedness of MRSA strains isolated from the endotracheal tubes (ETT) of intubated critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with nosocomial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibility to vancomycin, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid, gentamicin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, rifampicin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and tetracycline were measured. Resistance mechanisms were then analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Molecular epidemiology was carried out by multi-locus sequence typing. RESULTS: S. aureus isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, clindamycin, and fusidic acid. The most frequent mutations in quinolone-resistant S. aureus strains were S84L in the gyrA gene, V511A in the gyrB gene, S144P in the grlA gene, and K401R/E in the grlB gene. Strains resistant to erythromycin carried the ermC, ermA, and msrA genes; the same ermC and ermA genes were detected in strains resistant to clindamycin. The aac(6â\\x80²)-aph(2â\\x80³) gene was related to gentamicin resistance, while resistance to tetracycline was related to tetK (efflux pump). The fusB gene was detected in the strain resistant to fusidic acid. The most frequent sequence types were ST22, ST8, and ST217, which were distributed in four clonal complexes (CC5, CC22, CC45, and CC59). CONCLUSIONS: High levels of resistance to second-line antimicrobials threatens the treatment of nosocomial respiratory infections due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus with decreased susceptibility to linezolid and vancomycin. The wide genotypic diversity found reinforces the central role of ICU infection control in preventing nosocomial transmission.',\n",
       " \"The use of vaccines have resulted in a remarkable improvement in global health. It has saved several lives, reduced treatment costs and raised the quality of animal and human lives. Current traditional vaccines came empirically with either vague or completely no knowledge of how they modulate our immune system. Even at the face of potential vaccine design advance, immune-related concerns (as seen with specific vulnerable populations, cases of emerging/re-emerging infectious disease, pathogens with complex lifecycle and antigenic variability, need for personalized vaccinations, and concerns for vaccines' immunological safety -specifically vaccine likelihood to trigger non-antigen-specific responses that may cause autoimmunity and vaccine allergy) are being raised. And these concerns have driven immunologists toward research for a better approach to vaccine design that will consider these challenges. Currently, immunoinformatics has paved the way for a better understanding of some infectious disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, immune system response and computational vaccinology. The importance of this immunoinformatics in the study of infectious diseases is diverse in terms of computational approaches used, but is united by common qualities related to hostâ\\x80\\x93pathogen relationship. Bioinformatics methods are also used to assign functions to uncharacterized genes which can be targeted as a candidate in vaccine design and can be a better approach toward the inclusion of women that are pregnant into vaccine trials and programs.

The most virulent factors utilized by K. pneumoniae are; hypermucoviscous phenotype and mucoviscosity-related genes, genes for biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide, iron uptake and transport genes and finally, adhesive genes. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that, antimicrobial resistant in K. pneumoniae is a clear and present danger in Asia which needs strong surveillance to curb this menace. It is very important for public healthcare departments to monitor and report changes in antimicrobial-resistant isolates.',\n",
       " 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Men who have sex with men (MSM) in China experience elevated risks of mental health issues in comparison to the general population in China, which contribute to vulnerability to HIV/STI risks and can comprise the effectiveness of HIV prevention efforts. A conceptual framework for understanding this mental health disparity is minority stress theory, which posits that experiences of external prejudice events (i.e., distal stressors) and internal stress processes such as internalized homophobia and concealment (i.e., proximal stressors) contribute to sexual minoritiesâ\\x80\\x99 elevated risk of psychological distress. To deepen the understanding of mental health among Chinese MSM and explore the potential utility of minority stress theory in this population, this paper synthesizes research evidence regarding prevalent mental health issues as well as how minority stress may be linked to psychological health in Chinese MSM. RECENT FINDINGS: Results indicate that Chinese MSM experience a high prevalence of several mental health issues including depression, anxiety, suicidal behaviors, and alcohol dependence. SUMMARY: This review further reveals minority stress to be an important determinant of psychological distress among Chinese MSM, though evidence is mixed regarding the relationship between proximal minority stress and psychological health. Nonetheless, there is a lack of mental health services and interventions focusing on MSM in China. Culturally relevant, competent, and LGBT-affirmative mental health interventions are needed for Chinese MSM. To guide future intervention research, we provide considerations for reducing minority stress and promoting psychological health among Chinese MSM.',\n",
       " 'PURPOSE: It has been suggested that, by recruiting lung regions and enlarging the distribution volume of the cold indicator, increasing the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may lead to an artefactual overestimation of extravascular lung water (EVLW) by transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD). METHODS: In 60 ARDS patients, we measured EVLW (PiCCO2 device) at a PEEP level set to reach a plateau pressure of 30 cmH(2)O (HighPEEP(start)) and 15 and 45 min after decreasing PEEP to 5 cmH(2)O (LowPEEP(15â\\x80²) and LowPEEP(45â\\x80²), respectively). Then, we increased PEEP back to the baseline level (HighPEEP(end)). Between HighPEEP(start) and LowPEEP(15â\\x80²), we estimated the degree of lung derecruitment either by measuring changes in the compliance of the respiratory system (Crs) in the whole population, or by measuring the lung derecruited volume in 30 patients. We defined patients with a large derecruitment from the other ones as patients in whom the Crs changes and the measured derecruited volume were larger than the median of these variables observed in the whole population. RESULTS: Reducing PEEP from HighPEEP(start) (14 Â± 2 cmH(2)O) to LowPEEP(15â\\x80²) significantly decreased EVLW from 20 Â± 4 to 18 Â± 4 mL/kg, central venous pressure (CVP) from 15 Â± 4 to 12 Â± 4 mmHg, the arterial oxygen tension over inspired oxygen fraction (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) ratio from 184 Â± 76 to 150 Â± 69 mmHg and lung volume by 144 [68â\\x80\\x93420] mL. The EVLW decrease was similar in â\\x80\\x9clarge derecruitersâ\\x80\\x9d and the other patients. When PEEP was re-increased to HighPEEP(end), CVP, PaO(2)/FiO(2) and EVLW significantly re-increased. At linear mixed effect model, EVLW changes were significantly determined only by changes in PEEP and CVP (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03, respectively, n = 60). When the same analysis was performed by estimating recruitment according to lung volume changes (n = 30), CVP remained significantly associated to the changes in EVLW (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In ARDS patients, changing the PEEP level induced parallel, small and reversible changes in EVLW.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Existing methods for preparing influenza vaccines pose the greatest challenge against highly pandemic avian influenza H7N9 outbreak in the poultry and humans. Exploring a new strategy for manufacturing and delivering a safe and effective H7N9 vaccine is needed urgently. RESULTS: An alternative approach is to develop an influenza H7N9 oral vaccine based on yeast display technology in a timely manner. Hemagglutinin (HA) of A/Anhui/1/2013 (AH-H7N9) is used as a model antigen and characterized its expression on the surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S.cerevisiae) EBY 100. Mice administrated orally with S.cerevisiae EBY100/pYD5-HA produced significant titers of IgG antibody as well as significant amounts of cytokines IFN-Î³ and IL-4. Importantly, S.cerevisiae EBY100/pYD5-HA could provide effective immune protection against homologous A/Anhui/1/2013 (AH-H7N9) virus challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that platform based on yeast surface technology provides an alternative approach to prepare a promising influenza H7N9 oral vaccine candidate that can significantly shorten the preparedness period and result in effective protection against influenza A pandemic.',\n",
       " 'Vaccines based on Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) have failed due to extensive polymorphism in AMA1. To assess the strain-specificity of antibody responses to malaria infection and AMA1 vaccination, we designed protein and peptide microarrays representing hundreds of unique AMA1 variants. Following clinical malaria episodes, children had short-lived, sequence-independent increases in average whole-protein seroreactivity, as well as strain-specific responses to peptides representing diverse epitopes. Vaccination resulted in dramatically increased seroreactivity to all 263 AMA1 whole-protein variants. High-density peptide analysis revealed that vaccinated children had increases in seroreactivity to four distinct epitopes that exceeded responses to natural infection. A single amino acid change was critical to seroreactivity to peptides in a region of AMA1 associated with strain-specific vaccine efficacy. Antibody measurements using whole antigens may be biased towards conserved, immunodominant epitopes. Peptide microarrays may help to identify immunogenic epitopes, define correlates of vaccine protection, and measure strain-specific vaccine-induced antibodies.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The optimal timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation is debatable. Many articles in this field enrolled trials not based on acute kidney injury. The safety of the watchful waiting strategy has not been fully discussed, and late RRT initiation criteria vary across studies. The effect of early RRT initiation in the AKI population with high plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) has not been examined yet. METHODS: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were systemically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Trials not conducted in the AKI population were excluded. Data of study characteristics, primary outcome (all-cause mortality), and related secondary outcomes [mechanical ventilation (MV) days, length of hospital stay, RRT days, and length of ICU stay] were extracted. The outcomes were compared between early and late RRT groups by estimating the pooled odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes and the weighted mean difference for continuous outcomes. Prospective trials were also examined and analyzed using the same method. RESULTS: Nine RCTs with 1938 patients were included. Early RRT did not provide a survival benefit (pooled OR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62â\\x80\\x931.27). However, the early RRT group had significantly fewer MV days (pooled mean difference, â\\x88\\x92 3.98 days; 95% CI â\\x88\\x92 7.81 to â\\x88\\x92 0.15 days). Subgroup analysis showed that RCTs enrolling the surgical population (P = .001) and the AKI population with high plasma NGAL (P = .031) had favorable outcomes regarding RRT days in the early initiation group. Moreover, 6 of 9 RCTs were selected for examining the safety of the watchful waiting strategy, and no significant differences were found in primary and secondary outcomes between the early and late RRT groups. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, early RRT initiation did not provide a survival benefit, but a possible benefit of fewer MV days was detected. Early RRT might also provide the benefit of shorter MV or RRT support in the surgical population and in AKI patients with high plasma NGAL. Depending on the conventional indication for RRT initiation, the watchful waiting strategy is safe on the basis of all primary and secondary outcomes.',\n",
       " 'After the release of bilateral ureteral obstruction (BUO), postobstructive diuresis from an impaired urine concentration mechanism is associated with reduced aquaporin 2 (AQP2) abundance in the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD). However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this AQP2 reduction is incompletely understood. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon, we studied molecular changes in IMCDs isolated from rats with 4-h BUO or sham operation at the early onset of AQP2 downregulation using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Two-hundred fifteen proteins had significant changes in abundances, with 65% of them downregulated in the IMCD of 4-h BUO rats compared with sham rats. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that significantly changed proteins were associated with functional Gene Ontology terms, including â\\x80\\x9ccell-cell adhesion,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9ccell-cell adherens junction,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cmitochondrial inner membrane,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cendoplasmic reticulum chaperone complex,â\\x80\\x9d and the KEGG pathway of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry or immunoblot analysis confirmed the changes in 19 proteins representative of each predominant cluster, including AQP2. Electron microscopy demonstrated disrupted tight junctions, disorganized adherens junctions, swollen mitochondria, enlargement of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and numerous autophagosomes/lysosomes in the IMCD of rats with 4-h BUO. AQP2 and seven proteins chosen as representative of the significantly altered clusters had a significant increase in immunofluorescence-based colocalization with autophagosomes/lysosomes. Immunogold electron microscopy confirmed colocalization of AQP2 with the autophagosome marker microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 and the lysosomal marker cathepsin D in IMCD cells of rats with 4-h BUO. We conclude that enhanced autophagic degradation of AQP2 and other critical proteins, as well as endoplasmic reticulum stress in the IMCD, are initiated shortly after BUO.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Hymenoptera venom allergy (HVA) is an underestimated condition representing an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preventing future allergic reactions in patients who have already developed a systemic reaction is based on the correct management of the acute phase of the reaction followed by a correct diagnosis and, where indicated, prescription of adrenaline autoinjectors and VIT. A possible strategy to optimize care processes and to improve outcomes is the implementation of a Diagnostic and Therapeutic Care Pathways, also known as Integrated Care Pathways or Clinical Pathways (CPWs). The aim of the care pathway is to enhance the quality of care by improving riskâ\\x80\\x90adjusted patient outcomes, promoting patient safety, increasing patient satisfaction, and optimizing the use of resources. To our knowledge, currently in Italy as well as in Europe, there is no CPWs codified for the management of HVA patients. This paper describes the development of the clinical content of a care pathway for the management of HVA. METHODS: The methodology applied is based on the eight step method to build the clinical content of an evidence-based care pathway suggested by Lodewijckx et al. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventeen different clinical activities were extracted from the selected literature. The expert panel was involved in their evaluation, expressing a judgment of relevance through the Delphi study. As a result, 126 clinical activities were appraised to be valid and feasible. The final recommendations (126) were translated into 123 key interventions. Six indicators were produced by the clinical activities. CONCLUSION: A set of 123 key interventions and of six process indicators were found to be appropriate for the development and standardization of the clinical content of the Hymenoptera venom allergy care pathway.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Intractable, mechanical hemolytic anemia (IMHA) is a rare catastrophic complication following mitral valve surgery. We analyzed patient characteristics and IMHA management by reoperations after mitral valve surgery. METHODS: We collected medical records from mitral valve patients requiring reoperation due to IMHA. Inclusion criteria: hemoglobin < 100 g/L; positive hemolysis tests and echocardiography results; and exclusion of other hemolysis causes. RESULTS: Data from 25 IMHA cases included 10 (40%) early onset (1.3 (0.3,3.0) months) and 15 (60%) late onset (120 (24,204) months) cases. Early IMHA etiologies included surgical defects (6, 60%), uncontrolled infection (3, 30%) and Bechetâ\\x80\\x99s disease (1, 10%). Late IMHA etiologies included degeneration (13, 87%), new infection (1, 7%) and trauma (1, 7%). There were more mechanical valves (15, 88%) than bio-valves (2, 12%); the main valvular dysfunction was paravalvular leak (16, 64%). IMHA manifestations included jaundice (18, 72%), dark urine (21, 84%), heart failure (16, 64%), acute kidney injury (11, 44%), hepatomegaly (15, 60%), splenomegaly (15, 60%) and pancreatitis (1, 4%). Laboratory results showed decreased hemoglobin (70 Â± 14 g/L) and increased bilirubin (72 Â± 57 Î¼mol/L), lactate dehydrogenase (2607 Â± 2142 IU/L) and creatinine (136 Â± 101 Î¼mol/L) levels. Creatinine level negatively correlated with hemoglobin level (B = -3.33, S.E. B = 1.31, Exp(B) = 368.15, P = 0.018). Preoperative medications included iron supplements (20, 80%), erythropoietin (16, 64%) and beta-blocker (22, 88%). Two patients died of cardiac causes before reoperation. The other 23 underwent reoperation with long surgical times (aortic cross clamp 124 Â± 50 min, cardiopulmonary bypass 182 Â± 69 min) and blood transfusions (red blood cells 6 (6, 8) units, plasma 600 (400,800) ml, platelet 1(0,2) units). Postoperative complications included cardiac dysfunction (5, 22%), arrhythmia (10, 43%), sepsis (6, 26%), pulmonary infection (5, 22%), gastrointestinal bleeding (3, 13%), cerebral hemorrhage (2, 9%), chronic renal dysfunction (1, 4%) and surgical hemorrhage (1, 4%). Five (33%) patients died after reoperation from cardiac dysfunction (3, 60%), septic shock (1, 20%) and self-discharge (1, 20%). CONCLUSIONS: IMHA induces severe multi-organ dysfunction, contributing to high mortality. Perioperative management should focus on etiological treatment, organ protection, and blood management.',\n",
       " 'Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused enormous economic losses to the swine industry worldwide in recent years. Puerarin (PR), a major isoflavonoid isolated from the Chinese herb Gegen, possesses many pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, and anti-viral activities. This study was conducted with both PEDV-infected African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) and neonatal pigs to determine the effect of PR on PEDV infection and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by using proteomic analyses. Twenty-four piglets fed a milk replacer were randomly allocated into one of three groups (Control, PEDV, and PEDV + PR). After a 5-day period of adaption, piglets (n = 8/group) in the PEDV + PR were orally administered with PR (0.5 mg/kg body weight) between days 5 and 9, whereas piglets in the other two groups received the same volume of liquid milk replacer. On day 9, piglets were orally administered with either sterile saline or PEDV (Yunnan province strain) at 10(4.5) TCID(50) (50% tissue culture infectious dose) per pig. On day 12 of the trial, jugular vein blood and intestinal samples were collected. In addition, Vero cells were assigned randomly into three groups (Control, PEDV, PEDV + PR). Cells in the PEDV and PEDV + PR groups were infected with PEDV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01, while cells in the control group were treated with the same volume of sterile saline. One hour later, cells in the Control and PEDV groups were cultured in serum-free DMEM, while cells in the PEDV + PR group were supplemented with PR. After 36 h of culture, cells were harvested. PR attenuated the reductions in cell proliferation in vitro and growth performance in PEDV-infected piglets, and inhibited PEDV replication and the expression of several cytokines (including IL-8) both in vitro and in vivo. Proteomic analyses identified that the abundances of 29 proteins in the ileum were altered by PEDV infection and restored to the control level by PR. Pathway analyses revealed that PR restored the expression of several interferon-stimulated genes and selectively upregulated the expression of guanylate-binding proteins. Western blot analyses showed that PR supplementation inhibited the PEDV-induced NF-ÎºB activation. Collectively, these results indicate that PR could exert antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects in piglets infected with PEDV and have the potential to be an effective antiviral feed additive.',\n",
       " 'Base J, Î²-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil, is a modification of thymine DNA base involved in RNA Polymerase (Pol) II transcription termination in kinetoplastid protozoa. Little is understood regarding how specific thymine residues are targeted for J-modification or the mechanism of J regulated transcription termination. To identify proteins involved in J-synthesis, we expressed a tagged version of the J-glucosyltransferase (JGT) in Leishmania tarentolae, and identified four co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry: protein phosphatase (PP1), a homolog of Wdr82, a potential PP1 regulatory protein (PNUTS) and a protein containing a J-DNA binding domain (named JBP3). Gel shift studies indicate JBP3 is a J-DNA binding protein. Reciprocal tagging, co-IP and sucrose gradient analyses indicate PP1, JGT, JBP3, Wdr82 and PNUTS form a multimeric complex in kinetoplastids, similar to the mammalian PTW/PP1 complex involved in transcription termination via PP1 mediated dephosphorylation of Pol II. Using RNAi and analysis of Pol II termination by RNA-seq and RT-PCR, we demonstrate that ablation of PNUTS, JBP3 and Wdr82 lead to defects in Pol II termination at the 3â\\x80\\x99-end of polycistronic gene arrays in Trypanosoma brucei. Mutants also contain increased antisense RNA levels upstream of transcription start sites, suggesting an additional role of the complex in regulating termination of bi-directional transcription. In addition, PNUTS loss causes derepression of silent Variant Surface Glycoprotein genes involved in host immune evasion. Our results suggest a novel mechanistic link between base J and Pol II polycistronic transcription termination in kinetoplastids.',\n",

       " 'INTRODUCTION: Patient safety and critical care quality remain a challenging issue in the ICU. However, the effects of the national quality improvement (QI) program remain unknown in China. METHODS: A national ICU QI program was implemented in a controlled cohort of 586 hospitals from 2016 to 2018. The effects of the QI program on critical care quality were comprehensively investigated. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 81,461,554 patients were enrolled in 586 hospitals, and 1,587,724 patients were admitted to the ICU over 3 years. In 2018, there was a significantly higher number of ICU beds (2016 vs. 2018: 10668 vs. 13,661, P = 0.0132) but a lower doctor-to-bed ratio (2016 vs. 2018: 0.64 (0.50, 0.83) vs. 0.60 (0.45, 0.75), P = 0.0016) and nurse-to-bed ratio (2016 vs. 2018: 2.00 (1.64, 2.50) vs. 2.00 (1.50, 2.40), P = 0.031) than in 2016. Continuous and significant improvements in the ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) incidence rate, microbiology detection rate before antibiotic use and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis rate were associated with the implementation of the QI program (VAP incidence rate (per 1000 ventilator-days), 2016 vs. 2017 vs. 2018: 11.06 (4.23, 22.70) vs. 10.20 (4.25, 23.94) vs. 8.05 (3.13, 17.37), P = 0.0002; microbiology detection rate before antibiotic use (%), 2016 vs. 2017 vs. 2018: 83.91 (49.75, 97.87) vs. 84.14 (60.46, 97.24) vs. 90.00 (69.62, 100), P < 0.0001; DVT prophylaxis rate, 2016 vs. 2017 vs. 2018: 74.19 (33.47, 96.16) vs. 71.70 (38.05, 96.28) vs. 83.27 (47.36, 97.77), P = 0.0093). Moreover, the 6-h SSC bundle compliance rates in 2018 were significantly higher than those in 2016 (6-h SSC bundle compliance rate, 2016 vs. 2018: 64.93 (33.55, 93.06) vs. 76.19 (46.88, 96.67)). A significant change trend was not found in the ICU mortality rate from 2016 to 2018 (ICU mortality rate (%), 2016 vs. 2017 vs. 2018: 8.49 (4.42, 14.82) vs. 8.95 (4.89, 15.70) vs. 9.05 (5.12, 15.80), P = 0.1075). CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between medical human resources and ICU overexpansion was mismatched during the past 3 years. The implementation of a national QI program improved ICU performance but did not reduce ICU mortality.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by rapid-onset (within hours) acute inflammatory processes in lung tissue, and it is a life-threatening condition with high mortality. The treatment of ARDS to date is focused on the prevention of further iatrogenic damage of the lung rather than the treatment of the initial inflammatory process. Several preclinical studies have revealed a beneficial effect of iloprost on the control of pulmonary inflammation, and in a small number of patients with ARDS, iloprost treatment resulted in improved oxygenation. Therefore, we plan to conduct a large multicenter trial to evaluate the effect of iloprost on ARDS. METHODS: The Therapeutic Iloprost during ARDS trial (ThIlo trial) is a multicenter, randomized, single blinded, clinical phase II trial assessing the efficacy of inhaled iloprost for the prevention of the development and progression of ARDS in critically ill patients. One hundred fifty critically ill patients suffering from acute ARDS will be treated either by nebulized iloprost or NaCl 0.9% for 5 days. Blood samples will be drawn at defined time points to elucidate the serum levels of iloprost and inflammatory markers during treatment. Mechanical ventilation will be standardized. In follow-up visits at days 28 and 90 as well as 6 months after enrollment, functional status according to the Barthel Index and a health care-related questionnaire, and frailty (Vulnerable Elders Survey) will be evaluated. The primary endpoint is the improvement of oxygenation, defined as the ratio of PaO(2)/FiO(2). Secondary endpoints include 90-day all-cause mortality, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores during the study period up to day 90, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, ventilator-associated pneumonia, delirium, ICU-acquired weakness, and discharge localization. The study will be conducted in three university ARDS centers in Germany. DISCUSSION: The results of the ThIlo trial will highlight the anti-inflammatory effect of iloprost on early inflammatory processes during ARDS, resulting in the improvement of outcome parameters in patients with ARDS.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Human psittacosis, caused by Chlamydia (C.) psittaci, is likely underdiagnosed and underreported, since tests for C. psittaci are often not included in routine microbiological diagnostics. Source tracing traditionally focuses on psittacine pet birds, but recently other animal species have been gaining more attention as possible sources for human psittacosis. This review aims to provide an overview of all suspected animal sources of human psittacosis cases reported in the international literature. In addition, for each animal species the strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission was estimated. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using four databases (Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and Proquest). Articles were included when there was mention of at least one human case of psittacosis and a possible animal source. Investigators independently extracted data from the included articles and estimated strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission, based on a self-developed scoring system taking into account number of human cases, epidemiological evidence and laboratory test results in human, animals, and the environment. RESULTS: Eighty articles were included, which provided information on 136 different situations of possible zoonotic transmission. The maximum score for zoonotic transmission was highest for turkeys, followed by ducks, owls, and the category â\\x80\\x98other poultryâ\\x80\\x99. Articles reporting about zoonotic transmission from unspecified birds, psittaciformes and columbiformes provided a relatively low strength of evidence. A genotypical match between human and animal samples was reported twenty-eight times, including transmission from chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl, peafowl, pigeons, ducks, geese, songbirds, parrot-like birds and owls. CONCLUSIONS: Strong evidence exists for zoonotic transmission from turkeys, chickens and ducks, in addition to the more traditionally reported parrot-like animal sources. Based on our scoring system, the evidence was generally stronger for poultry than for parrot-like birds. Psittaciformes should not be disregarded as an important source of human psittacosis, still clinicians and public health officials should include poultry and birds species other than parrots in medical history and source tracing.',\n",

The aim of this confirmatory, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2/3 study was to assess the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of IC43 recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa vaccine in non-surgical ICU patients. METHODS: Eight hundred patients aged 18 to 80 years admitted to the ICU with expected need for mechanical ventilation for â\\x89¥ 48 h were randomized 1:1 to either IC43 100 Î¼g or saline placebo, given in two vaccinations 7 days apart. The primary efficacy endpoint was all-cause mortality in patients 28 days after the first vaccination. Immunogenicity and safety were also evaluated. FINDINGS: All-cause mortality rates at day 28 were 29.2% vs 27.7% in the IC43 and placebo groups, respectively (P = .67). Overall survival (Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, P = .46) and proportion of patients with â\\x89¥ one confirmed P. aeruginosa invasive infection or respiratory tract infection also did not differ significantly between both groups. The geometric mean fold increase in OprF/I titers was 1.5 after the first vaccination, 20 at day 28, after the second vaccination, and 2.9 at day 180. Significantly more patients in the placebo group (96.5%) had â\\x89¥ one adverse event (AE) versus the IC43 100 Î¼g group (93.1%) (P = .04). The most frequently reported severe AEs in the IC43 and placebo groups were respiratory failure (6.9% vs 5.7%, respectively), septic shock (4.1% vs 6.5%), cardiac arrest (4.3% vs 5.7%), multiorgan failure (4.6% vs 5.5%), and sepsis (4.6% vs 4.2%). No related serious AEs were reported in the IC43 group. INTERPRETATION: The IC43 100 Î¼g vaccine was well tolerated in this large population of medically ill, mechanically ventilated patients.

       " 'BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to validate a previously published consensus-based quality indicator set for the management of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) at intensive care units (ICUs) in Europe and to study its potential for quality measurement and improvement. METHODS: Our analysis was based on 2006 adult patients admitted to 54 ICUs between 2014 and 2018, enrolled in the CENTER-TBI study. Indicator scores were calculated as percentage adherence for structure and process indicators and as event rates or median scores for outcome indicators. Feasibility was quantified by the completeness of the variables. Discriminability was determined by the between-centre variation, estimated with a random effect regression model adjusted for case-mix severity and quantified by the median odds ratio (MOR). Statistical uncertainty of outcome indicators was determined by the median number of events per centre, using a cut-off of 10. RESULTS: A total of 26/42 indicators could be calculated from the CENTER-TBI database. Most quality indicators proved feasible to obtain with more than 70% completeness. Sub-optimal adherence was found for most quality indicators, ranging from 26 to 93% and 20 to 99% for structure and process indicators. Significant (p < 0.001) between-centre variation was found in seven process and five outcome indicators with MORs ranging from 1.51 to 4.14. Statistical uncertainty of outcome indicators was generally high; five out of seven had less than 10 events per centre. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, nine structures, five processes, but none of the outcome indicators showed potential for quality improvement purposes for TBI patients in the ICU. Future research should focus on implementation efforts and continuous reevaluation of quality indicators.

The purpose of this study was to explore major microbial trends in burn patients. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at burn wards and intensive care units, where burn patients were admitted following an event of dust explosion. Data were collected for a number of variables including severity of burns, demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and therapeutic devices. RESULTS: A total of 1132 specimens were collected from 37 hospitalized burn patients with mean TBSA of 46.1%.The most commonly isolated species were Staphylococcus spp. (22.4%). The highest rate of antibiotic resistance was observed in carbapenemâ\\x80\\x93resistant A. baumannii (14.6%), followed by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (11.3%).

       " 'BACKGROUND: Weaning of patients from the mechanical ventilation remains one of the critical decisions in intensive care unit. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of thoracic fluid content (TFC) as a predictor of weaning outcome. METHODS: An observational cohort study included 64 critically ill surgical patients who were eligible for extubation. Before initiating the spontaneous breathing trial, the TFC was measured using the electrical cardiometry technology. Patients were followed up after extubation and divided into successful weaning group and failed weaning group. Both groups were compared according to respiratory and cardiovascular parameters. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the ability of TFC to predict weaning outcome. RESULTS: The number of successfully weaned patients was 41/64 (64%). Twenty (31%) patients had impaired cardiac contractility, and of them, 13/20 (64%) patients were successfully extubated. Both groups, successful weaning group and failed weaning group, were comparable in most of baseline characteristics; however, the TFC was significantly higher in the failed weaning group compared to the successful weaning group. The area under the ROC curves (AUCs) showed moderate predictive ability for the TFC in predicting weaning failure (AUC [95% confidence interval] 0.69 [0.57â\\x80\\x930.8], cutoff value > 50 kÎ©(â\\x88\\x921)), while the predictive ability of TFC was excellent in the subgroup of patients with ejection fraction < 40% (AUC [95% confidence interval 0.93 [0.72â\\x80\\x931], cutoff value > 50 kÎ©(â\\x88\\x921)). CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic fluid content showed moderate ability for predicting weaning outcome in surgical critically ill patients.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of children hospitalised with LRTIs at a tertiary paediatric hospital in South Africa and to investigate the role and impact of ACT in these children. METHOD: A retrospective folder review of children hospitalised with LRTI between January and June 2015 was conducted, extracting data on demographic characteristics, health condition, ACT interventions and patient outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1208 individual cases (median [IQR] age 7.6 (2.8â\\x80\\x9319.0) months), in 1440 hospitalisations, were included. The majority of children were hospitalised primarily for the management of bronchiolitis. Comorbidities were present in 52.6% of patients during at least one of their hospitalisations. Airway clearance therapy was administered in 5.9% (n = 85) of admissions, most commonly conventional (manual) ACT. Transient oxyhaemoglobin desaturation was reported in six children, and one child developed lobar collapse an hour post-treatment. No other adverse events were reported. The median (IQR) duration of hospitalisation was 2.3 (1.5â\\x80\\x935.0) days, and the overall mortality rate was 0.7%. Children hospitalised for presumed nosocomial infections and pneumonia had the longest length of stay, were more likely to receive ACT and had the highest mortality rate. CONCLUSION: Airway clearance therapy was infrequently used in this population and was more commonly applied in those with nosocomial LRTI and pneumonia. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Although ACT was generally well tolerated, safety has not been ascertained, and oxygen saturation should be carefully monitored during therapy.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Public research organizations and their interactions with industry partners play a crucial role for public health and access to medicines. The development and commercialization of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines illustrate how licensing practices of public research organizations can contribute to high prices of the resulting product and affect accessibility to vulnerable populations. Efforts by the international community to improve access to medicines have recognised this issue and promote the public health-sensitive management of research conducted by public research organizations. This paper explores: how medical knowledge is exchanged between public and private actors; what role inventor scientists play in this process; and how they view the implementation of public health-sensitive knowledge exchange strategies. METHODS: We conducted a systematic qualitative literature review on medical knowledge exchange and qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of public sector scientists working on HPV vaccines. We explored the strategies by which knowledge is exchanged across institutional boundaries, how these strategies are negotiated, and the views of scientists regarding public health-sensitive knowledge exchange. RESULTS: We included 13 studies in the systematic review and conducted seven semi-structured interviews with high-ranking scientists. The main avenues of public-private medical knowledge exchange were publications, formal transfer of patented knowledge, problem-specific exchanges such as service agreements, informal exchanges and collaborative research. Scientists played a crucial role in these processes but appeared to be sceptical of public health-sensitive knowledge exchange strategies, as these were believed to deter corporate interest in the development of new medicines and thus risk the translation of the scientistsâ\\x80\\x99 research. CONCLUSION: Medical scientists at public research institutions play a key role in the exchange of knowledge they generate and are concerned about the accessibility of medicines resulting from their research. Their scepticism towards implementing public health-sensitive knowledge management strategies appears to be based on a biased understanding of the costs and risks involved in drug development and a perceived lack of alternatives to private engagement. Scientists could be encouraged to exchange knowledge in a public health-sensitive manner through not-for-profit drug development mechanisms, education on industry engagement, and stronger institutional and legal backing.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the feasibility of applying the respiratory â\\x80\\x9ccritical care-sub-critical care-rehabilitation integrated management modelâ\\x80\\x9d in severe stroke-associated pneumonia and evaluate its effect. METHODS: From January to September 2018, 24 patients with severe stroke-associated pneumonia, who were admitted to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit of the Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Department of Henan Provincial Peopleâ\\x80\\x99s Hospital, were randomly divided into two groups: integrated management group and control group. According to the admission criteria of the respiratory â\\x80\\x9ccritical care-sub-critical care-rehabilitation integrated modelâ\\x80\\x9d prescribed by the above-mentioned hospital, patients were grouped. The professional respiratory therapy team participated in the whole treatment. The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) and oxygenation index of these two groups were dynamically observed, and the average hospital stay, 28-day mortality and patient satisfaction were investigated. RESULTS: Patients in the integrated management group and control group were similar before treatment (P > 0.05). After treatment, the main indicators, the APACHE II score, CPIS score and oxygenation index, were significantly different between the integration group and control group (P < 0.05). The secondary indicators, the average hospitalization days and patient/family member satisfaction scores, were also significantly different between the integration group and control group (P < 0.05). However, the 28-day mortality wasnâ\\x80\\x99t significantly different (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with severe stroke-associated pneumonia, it was feasible to implement the respiratory â\\x80\\x9ccritical care-sub-critical care-rehabilitation integrated management modelâ\\x80\\x9d, which could significantly improve the treatment effect, shorten average hospitalization days and improve patient/family satisfaction.',\n",

Here, we performed a comprehensive and comparative phenotyping screening to identify phenotypic differences and similarities between the eight founder strains. In total, more than 300 parameters including allergy, behavior, cardiovascular, clinical blood chemistry, dysmorphology, bone and cartilage, energy metabolism, eye and vision, immunology, lung function, neurology, nociception, and pathology were analyzed; in most traits from sixteen females and sixteen males. We identified over 270 parameters that were significantly different between strains.

       " 'BACKGROUND: High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) may theoretically provide lung protective ventilation. The negative clinical results may be due to inadequate mean airway pressure (mPaw) settings in HFOV. Our objective was to evaluate the air distribution, ventilatory and hemodynamic effects of individual mPaw titration during HFOV in ARDS animal based on oxygenation and electrical impedance tomography (EIT). METHODS: ARDS was introduced with repeated bronchoalveolar lavage followed by injurious mechanical ventilation in ten healthy male pigs (51.2 Â± 1.9 kg). Settings of HFOV were 9 Hz (respiratory frequency), 33% (inspiratory time) and 70 cmH(2)O (â\\x88\\x86pressure). After lung recruitment, the mPaw was reduced in steps of 3 cmH(2)O every 6 min. Hemodynamics and blood gases were obtained in each step. Regional ventilation distribution was determined with EIT. RESULTS: PaO(2)/FiO(2) decreased significantly during the mPaw decremental phase (p < 0.001). Lung overdistended regions decreased, while recruitable regions increased as mPaw decreased. The optimal mPaw with respect to PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 21 (18.0â\\x80\\x9321.0) cmH(2)O, that is comparable to EIT-based center of ventilation (EIT-CoV) and EIT-collapse/over, 19.5 (15.0â\\x80\\x9321.0) and 19.5 (18.0â\\x80\\x9321.8), respectively (p = 0.07). EIT-CoV decreasing along with mPaw decrease revealed redistribution toward non-dependent regions. The individual mPaw titrated by EIT-based indices improved regional ventilation distribution with respect to overdistension and collapse (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Our data suggested personalized optimal mPaw titration by EIT-based indices improves regional ventilation distribution and lung homogeneity during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry is a powerful tool for the multiparameter analysis of leukocyte subsets on the single cell level. Recent advances have greatly increased the number of fluorochrome-labeled antibodies in flow cytometry. In particular, an increase in available fluorochromes with distinct excitation and emission spectra combined with novel multicolor flow cytometers with several lasers have enhanced the generation of multidimensional expression data for leukocytes and other cell types. However, these advances have mainly benefited the analysis of human or mouse cell samples given the lack of reagents for most animal species. The flow cytometric analysis of important veterinary, agricultural, wildlife, and other animal species is still hampered by several technical limitations, even though animal species other than the mouse can serve as more accurate models of specific human physiology and diseases. RESULTS: Here we present time-tested approaches that our laboratory regularly uses in the multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of ovine leukocytes. The discussed approaches will be applicable to the analysis of cells from most animal species and include direct modification of antibodies by covalent conjugation or Fc-directed labeling (Zenonâ\\x84¢ technology), labeled secondary antibodies and other second step reagents, labeled receptor ligands, and antibodies with species cross-reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Using refined technical approaches, the number of parameters analyzed by flow cytometry per cell sample can be greatly increased, enabling multidimensional analysis of rare samples and giving critical insight into veterinary and other less commonly analyzed species. By maximizing information from each cell sample, multicolor flow cytometry can reduce the required number of animals used in a study.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) requires urgent and specific antimicrobial therapy. However, the causal pathogen is typically unknown at the point when anti-infective therapeutics must be initiated. Physicians synthesize information from diverse data streams to make appropriate decisions. Artificial intelligence (AI) excels at finding complex relationships in large volumes of data. We aimed to evaluate the abilities of experienced physicians and AI to answer this question at patient admission: is it a viral or a bacterial pneumonia? METHODS: We included patients hospitalized for CAP and recorded all data available in the first 3-h period of care (clinical, biological and radiological information). For this proof-of-concept investigation, we decided to study only CAP caused by a singular and identified pathogen. We built a machine learning model prediction using all collected data. Finally, an independent validation set of samples was used to test the pathogen prediction performance of: (i) a panel of three experts and (ii) the AI algorithm. Both were blinded regarding the final microbial diagnosis. Positive likelihood ratio (LR) values > 10 and negative LR values < 0.1 were considered clinically relevant. RESULTS: We included 153 patients with CAP (70.6% men; 62 [51â\\x80\\x9373] years old; mean SAPSII, 37 [27â\\x80\\x9347]), 37% had viral pneumonia, 24% had bacterial pneumonia, 20% had a co-infection and 19% had no identified respiratory pathogen. We performed the analysis on 93 patients as co-pathogen and no-pathogen cases were excluded. The discriminant abilities of the AI approach were low to moderate (LR+ = 2.12 for viral and 6.29 for bacterial pneumonia), and the discriminant abilities of the experts were very low to low (LR+ = 3.81 for viral and 1.89 for bacterial pneumonia). CONCLUSION: Neither experts nor an AI algorithm can predict the microbial etiology of CAP within the first hours of hospitalization when there is an urgent need to define the anti-infective therapeutic strategy.',\n",
       " 'Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a global healthcare issue. CKD can progress to irreversible end-stage renal diseases (ESRD) or renal failure. The major risk factors for CKD include obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Understanding the key process involved in the disease development may lead to novel interventive strategies, which is currently lagging behind. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ (PPARÎ³) is one of the ligand-activated transcription factor superfamily members and is globally expressed in human tissues. Its agonists such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have been applied as effective antidiabetic drugs as they control insulin sensitivity in multiple metabolic tissues. Besides, TZDs exert protective effects in multiple other CKD risk disease contexts. As PPARÎ³ is abundantly expressed in major kidney cells, its physiological roles in those cells have been studied in both cell and animal models. The function of PPARÎ³ in the kidney ranges from energy metabolism, cell proliferation to inflammatory suppression, although major renal side effects of existing agonists (including TZDs) have been reported, which limited their application in treating CKD. In the current review, we systemically assess the function of PPARÎ³ in CKDs and the benefits and current limitations of its agonists in the clinical applications.',\n",
       " 'Esophageal malignancy is a disease with poor prognosis. Curative therapy incorporates surgery and is burdensome with high rates of infection morbidity and mortality. The role of yeast as causative organisms of post-esophagectomy infections is poorly defined. Consequently, the benefits of specific antifungal prophylactic therapy in improving patient outcome are unclear. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the incidence of yeast infections at the University Medical Center Groningen among 565 post-esophagectomy patients between 1991 and 2017. The results show that 7.3% of the patients developed a yeast infection after esophageal resection with significantly increased incidence among patients suffering from diabetes mellitus. For patients with yeast infections, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, more frequent intensive care unit readmissions, prolonged hospital stays and higher mortality rates were observed. One-year survival was significantly lower for patients with a yeast infection, as well as diabetes mellitus and yeast-positive pleural effusion. We conclude that the incidence of yeast infections following esophagectomy is considerable, and that patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk. Furthermore, yeast infections are associated with higher complication rates and mortality. These observations encourage further prospective investigations on the possible benefits of antifungal prophylactic therapy for esophagectomy patients.',\n",
       " 'A vaccine protective against diverse HCV variants is needed to control the HCV epidemic. Structures of E2 complexes with front layer-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) isolated from HCV-infected individuals, revealed a disulfide bond-containing CDRH3 that adopts straight (individuals who clear infection) or bent (individuals with chronic infection) conformation. To investigate whether a straight versus bent disulfide bond-containing CDRH3 is specific to particular HCV-infected individuals, we solved a crystal structure of the HCV E2 ectodomain in complex with AR3X, a bNAb with an unusually long CDRH2 that was isolated from the chronically-infected individual from whom the bent CDRH3 bNAbs were derived. The structure revealed that AR3X utilizes both its ultralong CDRH2 and a disulfide motif-containing straight CDRH3 to recognize the E2 front layer. These results demonstrate that both the straight and bent CDRH3 classes of HCV bNAb can be elicited in a single individual, revealing a structural plasticity of VH1-69-derived bNAbs.',\n",
       " 'Recent global advocacy efforts have highlighted the importance of development of a vaccine against group A Streptococcus (GAS). Combo5 is a non-M protein-based vaccine that provides protection against GAS skin infection in mice and reduces the severity of pharyngitis in nonhuman primates. However, Combo5 with the addition of aluminum hydroxide (alum) as an adjuvant failed to protect against invasive GAS infection of mice. Here, we show that formulation of Combo5 with adjuvants containing saponin QS21 significantly improves protective efficacy, even though all 7 adjuvants tested generated high antigen-specific IgG antibody titers, including alum. Detailed characterization of Combo5 formulated with SMQ adjuvant, a squalene-in-water emulsion containing a TLR4 agonist and QS21, showed significant differences from the results obtained with alum in IgG subclasses generated following immunization, with an absence of GAS opsonizing antibodies. SMQ, but not alum, generated strong interleukin-6 (IL-6), gamma interferon (IFN-Î³), and tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-Î±) responses. This work highlights the importance of adjuvant selection for non-M protein-based GAS vaccines to optimize immune responses and protective efficacy.',\n",
       " 'The nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway presents a challenge for RNA viruses with termination codons that precede extended 3â\\x80² untranslated regions (UTRs). The umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) is a nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA virus with an unusually long 3â\\x80² UTR that is susceptible to NMD. To establish a systemic infection, the PEMV2 long-distance movement protein p26 was previously shown to both stabilize viral RNAs and bind them for transport through the plantâ\\x80\\x99s vascular system. The current study demonstrated that p26 protects both viral and nonviral messenger RNAs from NMD. Although p26 localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleolus, p26 exerts its anti-NMD effects exclusively in the cytoplasm independently of long-distance movement. Using a transcriptome-wide approach in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana, p26 protected a subset of cellular NMD target transcripts, particularly those containing long, structured, GC-rich 3â\\x80² UTRs. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that the NMD pathway is highly dysfunctional during PEMV2 infection, with 1,820 (48%) of NMD targets increasing in abundance. Widespread changes in the host transcriptome are common during plant RNA virus infections, and these results suggest that, in at least some instances, virus-mediated NMD inhibition may be a major contributing factor.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Tick-borne lymphadenopathy (TIBOLA) is an infectious disease, mainly caused by species from the spotted fever group rickettsiae and is characterized by enlarged lymph nodes following a tick bite. Among cases of TIBOLA, a case of scalp eschar and neck lymphadenopathy after tick bite (SENLAT) is diagnosed when an eschar is present on the scalp, accompanied by peripheral lymphadenopathy (LAP). Only a few cases of SENLAT caused by Bartonella henselae have been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old male sought medical advice while suffering from high fever and diarrhea. Three weeks before the visit, he had been hunting a water deer, and upon bringing the deer home discovered a tick on his scalp area. Symptoms occurred one week after hunting, and a lump was palpated on the right neck area 6 days after the onset of symptoms. Physical examination upon presentation confirmed an eschar-like lesion on the right scalp area, and cervical palpation revealed that the lymph nodes on the right side were non-painful and enlarged at 2.5 Ã\\x97 1.5 cm. Fine needle aspiration of the enlarged lymph nodes was performed, and results of nested PCR for the Bartonella internal transcribed spacer (ITS) confirmed B. henselae as the causative agent. CONCLUSION: With an isolated case of SENLAT and a confirmation of B. henselae in Korea, it is pertinent to raise awareness to physicians in other Asian countries that B. henselae could be a causative agent for SENLAT.',\n",
       " 'Over the last two decades, the pig population in Africa has grown rapidly, reflecting the increased adoption of pig production as an important economic activity. Of all species, pigs are likely to constitute a greater share of the growth in the livestock subsector. However, constraints such as respiratory infectious diseases cause significant economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. Compared to industrialized countries, the occurrence and impacts of respiratory diseases on pig production in Africa is under-documented. Hence, knowledge on prevalence and incidence of economically important swine respiratory pathogens in pigs in Africa is necessary to guide interventions for prevention and control. The purpose of this review was to document the current status of research on five important respiratory pathogens of swine in Africa to inform future research and interventions. The pathogens included were porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSv), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) and swine influenza A viruses (IAV). For this review, published articles were obtained using Harzingâ\\x80\\x99s Publish or Perish software tool from GoogleScholar. Articles were also sourced from PubMed, ScienceDirect, FAO and OIE websites. The terms used for the search were Africa, swine or porcine, respiratory pathogens, M. hyopneumoniae, APP, PCV2, PPRSv, IAV, prevention and control. In all, 146 articles found were considered relevant, and upon further screening, only 85 articles were retained for the review. The search was limited to studies published from 2000 to 2019. Of all the studies that documented occurrence of the five respiratory pathogens, most were on IAV (48.4%, n = 15), followed by PCV2 (25.8%, n = 8), PPRSv (19.4%, n = 6), while only one study (3.2%, n = 1) reported APP and M. hyopneumoniae. This review highlights knowledge and information gaps on epidemiologic aspects as well as economic impacts of the various pathogens reported in swine in Africa, which calls for further studies.',\n",
       " 'Background: Bovine orthopneumovirus, formerly known as bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), is frequently associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Aim: To perform the molecular characterization of the G and F proteins of Brazilian wild-type BRSV strains derived from bovine respiratory infections in both beef and dairy cattle. Materials and Methods: Ten BRSV strains derived from a dairy heifer rearing unit (n = 3) in 2011 and steers of three other feedlots (n = 7) in 2014 and 2015 were analyzed. For the BRSV G and F partial gene amplifications, RT-nested-PCR assays were performed with sequencing in both directions with forward and reverse primers used. Results: The G gene-based analysis revealed that two strains were highly similar to the BRSV sequences representative of subgroup III, including the Bayovac vaccine strain. However, the remaining seven Brazilian BRSV strains were diverse when compared with strains representative of the BRSV I to VIII subgroups. The central hydrophobic region of the Brazilian BRSV G gene showed the replacement of conserved cysteines and other residues of importance to antibody reactivity. The deduced F gene amino acid sequences from the Brazilian BRSV strains showed changes that were absent in the representative sequences of the known subgroups. Viral isolation on the nasopharyngeal swab suspensions failed to isolate BRSV. Conclusion: Results suggest that these strains represent a putative new subgroup of BRSV with mutations observed in the immunodominant region of the G protein. However, further studies on these Brazilian BRSV strains should be performed to establish their pathogenic potential.',\n",
       " 'In recent years, many studies have drawn attention to the important role of collective awareness and human behaviour during epidemic outbreaks. A number of modelling efforts have investigated the interaction between the disease transmission dynamics and human behaviour change mediated by news coverage and by information spreading in the population. Yet, given the scarcity of data on public awareness during an epidemic, few studies have relied on empirical data. Here, we use fine-grained, geo-referenced data from three online sourcesâ\\x80\\x94Wikipedia, the GDELT Project and the Internet Archiveâ\\x80\\x94to quantify population-scale information seeking about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic in the U.S., explicitly linking such behavioural signal to epidemiological data. Geo-localized Wikipedia pageview data reveal that visiting patterns of Zika-related pages in Wikipedia were highly synchronized across the United States and largely explained by exposure to national television broadcast. Contrary to the assumption of some theoretical epidemic models, news volume and Wikipedia visiting patterns were not significantly correlated with the magnitude or the extent of the epidemic. Attention to Zika, in terms of Zika-related Wikipedia pageviews, was high at the beginning of the outbreak, when public health agencies raised an international alert and triggered media coverage, but subsequently exhibited an activity profile that suggests nonlinear dependencies and memory effects in the relation between information seeking, media pressure, and disease dynamics. This calls for a new and more general modelling framework to describe the interaction between media exposure, public awareness and disease dynamics during epidemic outbreaks.',\n",
       " 'PURPOSE: To examine the time to drug administration in patients with a witnessed cardiac arrest enrolled in the Pre-Hospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug Administration in Cardiac Arrest (PARAMEDIC2) randomised controlled trial. METHODS: The PARAMEDIC2 trial was undertaken across 5 NHS ambulance services in England and Wales with randomisation between December 2014 and October 2017. Patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were unresponsive to initial resuscitation attempts were randomly assigned to 1 mg intravenous adrenaline or matching placebo according to treatment packs that were identical apart from treatment number. Participants and study staff were masked to treatment allocation. RESULTS: 8016 patients were enrolled, 4902 sustained a witnessed cardiac arrest of whom 2437 received placebo and 2465 received adrenaline. The odds of return of spontaneous circulation decreased in both groups over time but at a greater rate in the placebo arm odds ratio (OR) 0.93 (95% CI 0.92â\\x80\\x930.95) compared with the adrenaline arm OR 0.96 (95% CI 0.95â\\x80\\x930.97); interaction OR: 1.03, 95% CI 1.01â\\x80\\x931.05, p = 0.005. By contrast, although the rate of survival and favourable neurological outcome decreased as time to treatment increased, the rates did not differ between the adrenaline and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: The rate of return of spontaneous circulation, survival and favourable neurological outcomes decrease over time. As time to drug treatment increases, adrenaline increases the chances of return of spontaneous circulation. Longer term outcomes were not affected by the time to adrenaline administration.

       " 'Macrophages have important protective functions during infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). However, molecular mechanisms that restrict viral propagation and protect from severe disease are unclear. Here we show that macrophages take up HSV-1 via endocytosis and transport the virions into multivesicular bodies (MVBs). In MVBs, acid ceramidase (aCDase) converts ceramide into sphingosine and increases the formation of sphingosine-rich intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). Once HSV-1 particles reach MVBs, sphingosine-rich ILVs bind to HSV-1 particles, which restricts fusion with the limiting endosomal membrane and prevents cellular infection. Lack of aCDase in macrophage cultures or in Asah1(â\\x88\\x92/â\\x88\\x92) mice results in replication of HSV-1 and Asah1(â\\x88\\x92/â\\x88\\x92) mice die soon after systemic or intravaginal inoculation. The treatment of macrophages with sphingosine enhancing compounds blocks HSV-1 propagation, suggesting a therapeutic potential of this pathway. In conclusion, aCDase loads ILVs with sphingosine, which prevents HSV-1 capsids from penetrating into the cytosol.',\n",

       " 'Although mechanical ventilation may be a patientâ\\x80\\x99s vital ally during acute illness, it can quickly transform into an enemy during chronic conditions. The weaning process is the fundamental phase that enables the resumption of physiological respiratory function; however, it is also associated with a number of life-threatening complications, and a large percentage of critically ill patients never achieve airway device removal or require the resumption of mechanical ventilation just a few days post-weaning. Indeed, the weaning process is, at present, more of an art than a science. As such, there is urgent need for novel contributions from the scientific literature to abate the growing rates of morbidity and mortality associated with weaning failure. The physician attempting to wean a patient must integrate clinical parameters and common-sense criteria. Numerous studies have striven to identify single predictive factors of weaning failure and sought to standardize the weaning process, but the results are characterized by remarkable heterogeneity. Despite the lack of benchmarks, it is clear that the analysis of respiratory function must include a detailed overview of the five situations described below rather than a single aspect.

The average interpersonal distance during close contact was 0.81 m. When sitting, students preferred small relative face orientation angle. Pairs of standing students preferred a face-to-face orientation during close contact which means this pattern had a lower infection risk via close contact.

Environmental hygiene in the wet market has established a link between the presence of rodents with probability of leptospirosis infection. This study was aimed to compare the level of knowledge, attitude and preventive practice against leptospirosis between healthy Malaysian and non-Malaysian wet market workers in selected wet markets in urban areas of Selangor. A cross-sectional study in the determined area was conducted with the participation of 147 respondents. The respondents were randomly chosen from the list provided by the state agency that regulates these markets.

       " 'BACKGROUND: The poorly known mycobacterial species Mycobacterium monacense is a rapidly growing non-tuberculous mycobacterium that was first described in 2006 (Reischl et al., Int J Syst Evol Microbiol 56:2575-8, 2006); it has been reported that its isolation is usually associated with skin and lung infections, especially in immunosuppressed patients (Hogardt et al., Jpn J Infect Dis 61:77-8, 2008; Taieb et al., J Hand Surg Am 33:94-6, 2008; Therese et al., Lung India 28:124-6, 2011; Shojaei et al., Ann Lab Med 32:87-90, 2012; Romero et al., New Microbes New Infect 10:112-5, 2016 ). The clinical significance of Mycobacterium monacense is not yet fully understood. Here, we report the first isolation of Mycobacterium monacense from the blood culture of a patient in China with severe pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: On June 26, 2018, a 38-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit with breathing difficulty. One day prior, he was discovered with his face immersed in a small pond (non-chlorinated water) and with limb convulsions. He had undergone craniocerebral surgery after trauma 5 years earlier, which left him with epilepsy as a sequela. Bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity was found in the lungs on chest X ray and chest CT image at admission. The result of the HIV serology test of the patient was negative. The patient was diagnosed with severe pneumonia. Drug-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida glabrata were isolated in the BALF, and yellow-pigmented colonies were isolated from blood cultures of the patient. The strain isolated from blood was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Mycobacteria monacense, which is a rapidly growing mycobacterium (RGM). The patient was treated with a combination of cefoperazone sulbactam, linezolid and voriconazole for 10 days, and the symptoms improved. During the one-year follow-up time, the patient did not relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of M. monacense isolated from blood cultures in a patient with severe pneumonia, which provided evidence that the environmental microorganism possessed pathogenic characteristics.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Children with Down syndrome (DS) show a high susceptibility to recurrent infections (RI), caused by immune defects and abnormalities of the airways. Our goal was to investigate the effects of Pidotimod on RI prevention in children with DS, comparing immune and clinical parameters before (T0) and after (T1) the treatment with Pidotimod. METHODS: The study was conducted at the Down syndrome outpatient Center of Bambino GesÃ¹ Childrenâ\\x80\\x99s Hospital, in Rome. We reviewed the medical records of all children with a positive history for RI and who received oral prophylaxis of Pidotimod from September 2016 to February 2017. RESULTS: Thirty-three children met the inclusion criteria (males: 51.5%; average age: 6 years Â±SD: 3). We found a significant decrease in the number of children with upper respiratory infections (82% at T0 vs 24% at T1; p = 0,0001) and with lower respiratory infections (36% at T0 vs 9% at T1; p = 0.003) after treatment with Pidotimod. We also demonstrated a significant decrease in the number of children hospitalized for respiratory infections (18% at T0 vs 3% at T1; p = 0.03). We measured T and B cells in the peripheral blood and B cell function in vitro at T0 and T1. We found that the response to CpG improved at T1. A significant increase of B cell frequency (p = 0.0009), B cell proliferation (p = 0.0278) and IgM secretion (p = 0.0478) were observed in children with DS after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provided evidence that Pidotimod may be able to prevent RI in children with Down syndrome.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The International Standards for a Safe Practice of Anesthesia (ISSPA) were developed on behalf of the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists and the World Health Organization. It has been recommend as an assessment tool that allows anesthetic providers in developing countries to assess their compliance and needs. This study was performed to describe the anesthesia service in one main public hospital during an 8-month medical mission in Cambodia and evaluate its anesthetic safety issues according to the ISSPA. METHODS: We conduct a retrospective study involving 1953 patients at the Preah Ket Mealea hospital. Patient demographics, anesthetic techniques, and complications were reviewed according to the registers of the anesthetic services and questionnaires. The inadequacies in personnel, facilities, equipment, medications, and conduct of anesthesia drugs were recorded using a checklist based on the ISSPA. RESULTS: A total of 1792 patients received general and regional anesthesia in the operating room, while 161 patients receiving sedation for gastroscopy. The patientsâ\\x80\\x99 mean age was 45.0 Â± 16.6 years (range, 17â\\x80\\x9387 years). The three most common surgical procedures were abdominal (52.0%; confidence interval [CI], 49.3â\\x80\\x9354.7), orthopedic (27.6%; CI, 25.2â\\x80\\x9329.9), and urological surgery (14.7%; CI, 12.8â\\x80\\x9316.6). General anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, and brachial plexus block were performed in 54.3% (CI, 51.7â\\x80\\x9356.8), 28.2% (CI, 25.9â\\x80\\x9330.5), and 9.4% (CI, 7.9â\\x80\\x9310.9) of patients, respectively. One death occurred. Twenty-six items related to professional aspects, monitoring, and conduct of anesthesia did not meet the ISSPA-recommended standards. A lack of commonly used drugs and monitoring equipment was noted, posing major threats to the safety of anesthesia practice, especially in emergency situations. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the scarce literature on anesthesia practice in low- and middle-income countries such as Cambodia. Future medical assistance should help to strengthen these countriesâ\\x80\\x99 inadequacies, allowing for the adoption of international standards for the safe practice of anesthesia.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Diaphragm atrophy and dysfunction are consequences of mechanical ventilation and are determinants of clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that partial preservation of diaphragm function, such as during assisted modes of ventilation, will restore diaphragm thickness. We also aim to correlate the changes in diaphragm thickness and function to outcomes and clinical factors. METHODS: This is a prospective, multicentre, observational study. Patients mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h in controlled mode and eventually switched to assisted ventilation were enrolled. Diaphragm ultrasound and clinical data collection were performed every 48 h until discharge or death. A threshold of 10% was used to define thinning during controlled and recovery of thickness during assisted ventilation. Patients were also classified based on the level of diaphragm activity during assisted ventilation. We evaluated the association between changes in diaphragm thickness and activity and clinical outcomes and data, such as ventilation parameters. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients ventilated in controlled mode and then switched to the assisted mode of ventilation were enrolled. Diaphragm thickness significantly decreased during controlled ventilation (1.84 Â± 0.44 to 1.49 Â± 0.37 mm, p < 0.001) and was partially restored during assisted ventilation (1.49 Â± 0.37 to 1.75 Â± 0.43 mm, p < 0.001). A diaphragm thinning of more than 10% was associated with longer duration of controlled ventilation (10 [5, 15] versus 5 [4, 8.5] days, p = 0.004) and higher PEEP levels (12.6 Â± 4 versus 10.4 Â± 4 cmH(2)O, p = 0.034). An increase in diaphragm thickness of more than 10% during assisted ventilation was not associated with any clinical outcome but with lower respiratory rate (16.7 Â± 3.2 versus 19.2 Â± 4 bpm, p = 0.019) and Rapid Shallow Breathing Index (37 Â± 11 versus 44 Â± 13, p = 0.029) and with higher Pressure Muscle Index (2 [0.5, 3] versus 0.4 [0, 1.9], p = 0.024). Change in diaphragm thickness was not related to diaphragm function expressed as diaphragm thickening fraction. CONCLUSION: Mode of ventilation affects diaphragm thickness, and preservation of diaphragmatic contraction, as during assisted modes, can partially reverse the muscle atrophy process. Avoiding a strenuous inspiratory work, as measured by Rapid Shallow Breathing Index and Pressure Muscle Index, may help diaphragm thickness restoration.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The â\\x80\\x9cEND-of-Life ScorING-Systemâ\\x80\\x9d (ENDING-S) was previously developed to identify patients at high-risk of dying in the ICU and to facilitate a practical integration between palliative and intensive care. The aim of this study is to prospectively validate ENDING-S in a cohort of long-term critical care patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult long-term ICU patients (with a length-of-stay> 4 days) were considered for this prospective multicenter observational study. ENDING-S and SOFA score were calculated daily and evaluated against the patientâ\\x80\\x99s ICU outcome. The predictive properties were evaluated through a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty patients were enrolled for this study. Among these, 21.46% died during the ICU stay. ENDING-S correctly predicted the ICU outcome in 71.4% of patients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values associated with the previously identified ENDING-S cut-off of 11.5 were 68.1, 72.3, 60 and 89.3%, respectively. ROC-AUC for outcome prediction was 0.79 for ENDING-S and 0.88 for SOFA in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: ENDING-S, while not as accurately as in the pilot study, demonstrated acceptable discrimination properties in identifying long-term ICU patients at very high-risk of dying. ENDING-S may be a useful tool aimed at facilitating a practical integration between palliative, end-of-life and intensive care.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Dengue is an emerging infectious disease that infects up to 390 million people yearly. The growing demand of dengue diagnostics especially in low-resource settings gave rise to many rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). This study evaluated the accuracy and utility of ViroTrack Dengue Acute - a new biosensors-based dengue NS1 RDT, SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1/IgM/IgG combo - a commercially available RDT, and SD Dengue NS1 Ag enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for the diagnosis of acute dengue infection. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study consecutively recruited 494 patients with suspected dengue from a health clinic in Malaysia. Both RDTs were performed onsite. The evaluated ELISA and reference tests were performed in a virology laboratory. The reference tests comprised of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and three ELISAs for the detection of dengue NS1 antigen, IgM and IgG antibodies, respectively. The diagnostic performance of evaluated tests was computed using STATA version 12. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of ViroTrack were 62.3% (95%CI 55.6â\\x80\\x9368.7) and 95.0% (95%CI 91.7â\\x80\\x9397.3), versus 66.5% (95%CI 60.0â\\x80\\x9372.6) and 95.4% (95%CI 92.1â\\x80\\x9397.6) for SD NS1 ELISA, and 52.4% (95%CI 45.7â\\x80\\x9359.1) and 97.7% (95%CI 95.1â\\x80\\x9399.2) for NS1 component of SD Bioline, respectively. The combination of the latter with its IgM and IgG components were able to increase test sensitivity to 82.4% (95%CI 76.8â\\x80\\x9387.1) with corresponding decrease in specificity to 87.4% (95%CI 82.8â\\x80\\x9391.2). Although a positive test on any of the NS1 assays would increase the probability of dengue to above 90% in a patient, a negative result would only reduce this probability to 23.0â\\x80\\x9329.3%. In contrast, this probability of false negative diagnosis would be further reduced to 14.7% (95%CI 11.4â\\x80\\x9318.6) if SD Bioline NS1/IgM/IgG combo was negative. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of ViroTrack Dengue Acute was comparable to SD Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA. Addition of serology components to SD Bioline Dengue Duo significantly improved its sensitivity and reduced its false negative rate such that it missed the fewest dengue patients, making it a better point-of-care diagnostic tool. New RDT like ViroTrack Dengue Acute may be a potential alternative to existing RDT if its combination with serology components is proven better in future studies.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with high rates of long-term disability and mortality. Our aim was to investigate the effects of thoracic trauma on the in-hospital course and outcome of patients with TBI. METHODS: We performed a matched pair analysis of the multicenter trauma database TraumaRegisterDGUÂ® (TR-DGU) in the 5-year period from 2012 to 2016. We included adult patients (â\\x89¥18 years of age) with moderate to severe TBI (abbreviated injury scale (AIS)= 3â\\x80\\x935). Patients with isolated TBI (group 1) were compared to patients with TBI and varying degrees of additional blunt thoracic trauma (AIS(Thorax)= 2â\\x80\\x935) (group 2). Matching criteria were gender, age, severity of TBI, initial GCS and presence/absence of shock. The Ï\\x87(2)-test was used for comparing categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney-U-test was chosen for continuous parameters. Statistical significance was defined by a p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 5414 matched pairs (10,828 patients) were included. The presence of additional thoracic injuries in patients with TBI was associated with a longer duration of mechanical ventilation and a prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay. Additional thoracic trauma was also associated with higher mortality rates. These effects were most pronounced in thoracic AIS subgroups 4 and 5. Additional thoracic trauma, regardless of its severity (AIS(Thorax) â\\x89¥2) was associated with significantly decreased rates of good neurologic recovery (GOS = 5) after TBI. CONCLUSIONS: Chest trauma in general, regardless of its initial severity (AIS(Thorax)= 2â\\x80\\x935), is associated with decreased chance of good neurologic recovery after TBI. Affected patients should be considered â\\x80\\x9cat riskâ\\x80\\x9d and vigilance for the maintenance of optimal neuro-protective measures should be high.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: China has emerged as a powerful platform for global pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) amid the 2014 Ebola outbreak. The research and development impact of developing countries on prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks has long been underestimated, particularly for emerging economies like China. Here, we studied its research and development progress and government support in response to Ebola outbreak by timeline, input, and output at each research and development stage. This study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the research and development gaps and challenges faced by China, as well as providing evidence-based suggestions on how to accelerate the drug development process to meet urgent needs during future outbreaks. METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Nature Science Foundation of China database, PubMed database, Patent Search System of the State Intellectual Property Office of China, National Medical Products Administration, national policy reports and literature between Jan 1st, 2006 and Dec 31st, 2017. An overview of research funding, research output, pharmaceutical product patent, and product licensed was described and analyzed by Microsoft Excel. A descriptive analysis with a visualization of plotting charts and graphs was conducted by reporting the mean Â± standard deviation. RESULTS: China has successfully completed the research and development of the Ebola Ad5-EBOV vaccine within 26 months, while the preparation and implementation of clinical trials took relative long time. The National Nature Science Foundation of China funded CNY 44.05 million (USD 6.27 million) for Ebola-related researches and committed strongly to the phase of basic research (87.8%). A proliferation of literature arose between 2014 and 2015, with a 1.7-fold increase in drug research and a 2.5-fold increase in diagnostic research within 1 year. Three years on from the Ebola outbreak, six Ebola-related products in China were approved by the National Medical Products Administration. CONCLUSIONS: China has started to emphasize the importance of medical product innovation as one of the solutions for tackling emerging infectious diseases. Continuing research on the development of regulatory and market incentives, as well as a multilateral collaboration mechanism that unifies cross-channel supports, would advance the process for China to enter global R&D market more effectively.',\n",

       " 'Adjuvants are central to the efficacy of subunit vaccines. Aluminum hydroxide (alum) is the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant, yet its adjuvanticity is often weak and mechanisms of triggering antibody responses remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that site-specific modification of immunogens with short peptides composed of repeating phosphoserine (pSer) residues enhances binding to alum and prolongs immunogen bioavailability. The pSer-modified immunogens formulated in alum elicited greatly increased germinal center, antibody, neutralizing antibody, memory and long-lived plasma cell responses compared to conventional alum-adsorbed immunogens. Mechanistically, pSer-immunogen:alum complexes form nanoparticles that traffic to lymph nodes and trigger B cell activation through multivalent and oriented antigen display. Direct uptake of antigen-decorated alum particles by B cells upregulated antigen processing and presentation pathways, further enhancing B cell activation. These data provide insights into mechanisms of action of alum and introduce a readily translatable approach to significantly improve humoral immunity to subunit vaccines using a clinical adjuvant.',\n",
       " 'The term â\\x80\\x9camyloidâ\\x80\\x9d refers to proteinaceous deposits of peptides that might be generated from larger precursor proteins e.g., by proteolysis. Common to these peptides is a stable cross-Î² dominated secondary structure which allows self-assembly, leading to insoluble oligomers and lastly to fibrils. These highly ordered protein aggregates have been, for a long time, mainly associated with human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâ\\x80\\x99s disease (Amyloid-Î² peptides). However, they also exert physiological functions such as in release of deposited hormones in human beings. In the light of the rediscovery of our microbial commensals as important companions in health and disease, the fact that microbes also possess amyloidogenic peptides is intriguing. Transmission of amyloids by iatrogenic means or by consumption of contaminated meat from diseased animals is a well-known fact. What if also our microbial commensals might drive human amyloidosis or suffer from our aggregated amyloids? Moreover, as the microbial amyloids are evolutionarily older, we might learn from these organisms how to cope with the sword of Damocles forged of endogenous, potentially toxic peptides. This review summarizes knowledge about the interplay between human amyloids involved in neurodegenerative diseases and microbial amyloids.',\n",
       " 'Hookworm infection is a major public health problem that threatens about 500 million people throughout tropical areas of the world. Adult hookworms survive for many years in the host intestine, where they suck blood, causing iron deficiency anemia and malnutrition. Numerous molecules, named excretory/secretory (ES) products, are secreted by hookworm adults and/or larvae to aid in parasite survival and pathobiology. Although the molecular cloning and characterization of hookworm ES products began 25 years ago, the biological role and molecular nature of many of them are still unclear. Hookworm ES products, with distinct structures and functions, have been linked to many essential events in the disease pathogenesis. These events include host invasion and tissue migration, parasite nourishment and reproduction, and immune modulation. Several of these products represent promising vaccine targets for controlling hookworm disease and therapeutic targets for many inflammatory diseases. This review aims to summarize our present knowledge about hookworm ES products, including their role in parasite biology, host-parasite interactions, and as vaccine and pharmaceutical targets and to identify research gaps and future research directions in this field.

       " 'BACKGROUND: The majority of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s perinatal deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. A substantial proportion occurs intrapartum and is avoidable with better care. At a low-resource tertiary hospital, this study assessed the quality of intrapartum care and adherence to locally-tailored clinical guidelines. METHODS: A non-participatory, structured, direct observation study was held at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, Zanzibar, Tanzania, between October and November 2016. Women in active labour were followed and structure, processes of labour care and outcomes of care systematically recorded. Descriptive analyses were performed on the labour observations and compared to local guidelines and supplemented by qualitative findings. A Poisson regression analysis assessed factors affecting foetal heart rate monitoring (FHRM) guidelines adherence. RESULTS: 161 labouring women were observed. The nurse/midwife-to-labouring-women ratio of 1:4, resulted in doctors providing a significant part of intrapartum monitoring. Care during labour and two-thirds of deliveries was provided in a one-room labour ward with shared beds. Screening for privacy and communication of examination findings were done in 50 and 34%, respectively. For the majority, there was delayed recognition of labour progress and insufficient support in second stage of labour. While FHRM was generally performed suboptimally with a median interval of 105 (interquartile range 57â\\x80\\x93160) minutes, occurrence of an intrapartum risk event (non-reassuring FHR, oxytocin use or poor progress) increased assessment frequency significantly (rate ratio 1.32 (CI 1.09â\\x80\\x931.58)). CONCLUSIONS: Neither international nor locally-adapted standards of intrapartum routine care were optimally achieved. This was most likely due to a grossly inadequate capacity of birth attendants; without whom innovative interventions at birth are unlikely to succeed. This calls for international and local stakeholders to address the root causes of unsafe intrafacility care in low-resource settings, including the number of skilled birth attendants required for safe and respectful births.',\n",

Plasmids from bla(NDM)-positive isolates were transformed into a carbapenem-susceptible A. baumannii (CS-AB) isolate to assess the role of plasmid transfer in mediating carbapenem resistance. Imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem MIC90 values against bla(NDM)-positive isolates were 128, > 256, and 256 Âµg/mL, respectively. Plasmid isolation and polymerase chain reaction revealed that bla(NDM) was plasmid mediated. The plasmids were electroporated into the cells of a CS-AB isolate at an efficiency of 1.3 Ã\\x97 10(â\\x80\\x938) to 2.6 Ã\\x97 10(â\\x80\\x937), transforming them to bla(NDM)-positive carbapenem-resistant cells with an imipenem MIC increase of 256-fold. In addition to carbapenem resistance, the bla(NDM)-positive isolates also exhibited higher levels of cephalosporins, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and colistin resistance than the bla(NDM)-negative isolates. Acquisition of bla(NDM)-carrying plasmids dramatically increased imipenem resistance among A. baumannii isolates. Intriguingly, bla(NDM)-positive isolates also showed a high degree of resistance to antibiotics of different classes. The potential co-existence of different resistance determinants on A. baumannii plasmids and their possible transfer owing to the natural competence of the pathogen are especially alarming. More effective infection control and antibiotic stewardship programs are needed to curb the spread and treat such infections in both hospital and community settings.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Obesity occurs when the bodyâ\\x80\\x99s energy intake is constantly greater than its energy consumption and the pharmacological enhancing the activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and (or) browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) has been considered promising strategies to treat obesity. METHODS: In this study, we took a multi-pronged approach to screen UCP1 activators, including in silico predictions, in vitro assays, as well as in vivo experiments. RESULTS: Base on Connectivity MAP (CMAP) screening, we obtained multiple drugs that possess a remarkably correlating gene expression pattern to that of enhancing activity in BAT and (or) sWAT signature. Particularly, we focused on a previously unreported drug-indirubin, a compound obtained from the Indigo plant, which is now mainly used for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In the current study, our results shown that indirubin could enhance the BAT activity, as evidenced by up-regulated Ucp1 expression and enhanced mitochondrial respiratory function in vitro cellular model. Furthermore, indirubin treatment restrained high-fat diet (HFD)-induced body weight gain, improved glucose homeostasis and ameliorated hepatic steatosis which were associated with the increase of energy expenditure in the mice model. Moreover, we revealed that indirubin treatment increased BAT activity by promoting thermogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in BAT and induced browning of subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue (sWAT) of mice under HFD. Besides, our results indicated that indirubin induced UCP1 expression in brown adipocytes, at least in part, via activation of PKA and p38MAPK signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly show that as an effective BAT (as well as beige cells) activator, indirubin may have a protective effect on the prevention and treatment of obesity and its complications.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: To explore the effects of the respiratory rate (RR) on the venous-to-arterial CO(2) tension difference (gapCO(2)) in septic shock patients undergoing volume mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Adult patients with septic shock underwent volume mechanical ventilation between October 2015 and October 2016. RR was started at 10 breaths/min, and 2 breaths/min were added every 60 min until 16 breaths/min was reached. At every point, central venous and arterial blood gas measurements were obtained simultaneously. RESULTS: In this study, gapCO(2) induced by hyperventilation significantly increased, while the central venous carbon dioxide pressure (PvCO(2)) and the partial pressure of CO(2) (PaCO(2)) in arteries decreased. The decreasing trend of the PaCO(2) was more obvious than that of the PvCO(2). HCO(3)(â\\x88\\x92) and ctCO(2) were markedly decreased, when the RR was increased (P < 0.05). Central venous oxygen saturation (S(cv)O(2)) had a decreasing trend between 14 (77.1 Â± 8.3%) and 16 (75.2 Â± 8.7%) breaths/min; however, the difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: In septic patients undergoing ventilation, respiratory alkalosis induced by hyperventilation caused an increase in the gapCO(2). Clinicians should cautiously interpret the gapCO(2) in hemodynamically stable ventilated septic shock patients and its relationship with low cardiac output and inadequate perfusion.',\n",

Next, we employed small-angle X-ray scattering techniques to study solution conformation and low-resolution structures of these RNAs, which suggest that the 3â\\x80\\x99 terminal regions are highly extended as compared to the 5â\\x80\\x99 terminal regions for both viruses. Using computational modeling tools, we reconstructed 3-dimensional structures of each RNA fragment and compared them with derived small-angle X-ray scattering low-resolution structures. This approach allowed us to reinforce that the 5â\\x80\\x99 terminal regions adopt more dynamic structures compared to the mainly double-stranded structures of the 3â\\x80\\x99 terminal regions.',\n",
       " 'Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a zoonotic, negative-stranded RNA virus of the family Rhabdoviridae. The nucleoprotein (N) of VSV protects the viral genomic RNA and plays an essential role in viral transcription and replication, which makes the nucleoprotein an ideal target of host defense. However, whether and how host innate/intrinsic immunity limits VSV infection by targeting the N protein are unknown. In this study, we found that the N protein of VSV (VSV-N) interacted with a ubiquitin E3 ligase, tripartite motif protein 41 (TRIM41). Overexpression of TRIM41 inhibited VSV infection. Conversely, the depletion of TRIM41 increased host susceptibility to VSV. Furthermore, the E3 ligase defective mutant of TRIM41 failed to limit VSV infection, suggesting the requirement of the E3 ligase activity of TRIM41 in viral restriction. Indeed, TRIM41 ubiquitinated VSV-N in cells and in vitro. TRIM41-mediated ubiquitination leads to the degradation of VSV-N through proteasome, thereby limiting VSV infection. Taken together, our study identifies TRIM41 as a new intrinsic immune factor against VSV by targeting the viral nucleoprotein for ubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation.',\n",
       " 'The discovery and characterization of novel arthropod-borne viruses provide valuable information on their genetic diversity, ecology, evolution and potential to threaten animal or public health. Arbovirus surveillance is not conducted regularly in Romania, being particularly very scarce in the remote and diverse areas like the Danube Delta. Here we describe the detection and genetic characterization of a novel orbivirus (Reoviridae: Orbivirus) designated as Letea virus, which was found in grass snakes (Natrix natrix) during a metagenomic and metatranscriptomic survey conducted between 2014 and 2017. This virus is the first orbivirus discovered in reptiles. Phylogenetic analyses placed Letea virus as a highly divergent species in the Culicoides-/sand fly-borne orbivirus clade. Gene reassortment and intragenic recombination were detected in the majority of the nine Letea virus strains obtained, implying that these mechanisms play important roles in the evolution and diversification of the virus. However, the screening of arthropods, including Culicoides biting midges collected within the same surveillance program, tested negative for Letea virus infection and could not confirm the arthropod vector of the virus. The study provided complete genome sequences for nine Letea virus strains and new information about orbivirus diversity, host range, ecology and evolution. The phylogenetic associations warrant further screening of arthropods, as well as sustained surveillance efforts for elucidation of Letea virus natural cycle and possible implications for animal and human health.',\n",
       " 'Histiocytic sarcomas represent malignant tumors which require new treatment strategies. Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a promising candidate due to its oncolytic features reported in a canine histiocytic sarcoma cell line (DH82 cells). Interestingly, the underlying mechanism might include a dysregulation of angiogenesis. Based on these findings, the aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of a persistent CDV-infection on oxidative stress mediated changes in the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1Î± and its angiogenic downstream pathway in DH82 cells in vitro. Microarray data analysis, immunofluorescence for 8-hydroxyguanosine, superoxide dismutase 2 and catalase, and flow cytometry for oxidative burst displayed an increased oxidative stress in persistently CDV-infected DH82 cells (DH82Ond pi) compared to controls. The HIF-1Î± expression in DH82Ond pi increased, as demonstrated by Western blot, and showed an unexpected, often sub-membranous distribution, as shown by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Furthermore, microarray data analysis and immunofluorescence confirmed a reduced expression of VEGF-B in DH82Ond pi compared to controls. In summary, these results suggest a reduced activation of the HIF-1Î± angiogenic downstream pathway in DH82Ond pi cells in vitro, most likely due to an excessive, unusually localized, and non-functional expression of HIF-1Î± triggered by a CDV-induced increased oxidative stress.',\n",
       " 'Real-time molecular techniques have become the reference methods for direct diagnosis of pathogens. The reduction of steps is a key factor in order to decrease the risk of human errors resulting in invalid series and delayed results. We describe here a process of preparation of oligonucleotide primers and hydrolysis probe in a single tube at predefined optimized concentrations that are stabilized via lyophilization (Lyoph-P&P). Lyoph-P&P was compared versus the classic protocol using extemporaneously prepared liquid reagents using (i) sensitivity study, (ii) long-term stability at 4 Â°C, and (iii) long-term stability at 37 Â°C mimicking transportation without cold chain. Two previously published molecular assays were selected for this study. They target two emerging viruses that are listed on the blueprint of the WHO as to be considered for preparedness and response actions: chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV). Results of our study demonstrate that (i) Lyoph-P&P is stable for at least 4 days at 37 Â°C supporting shipping without the need of cold chain, (ii) Lyoph-P&P rehydrated solution is stable at +4 Â°C for at least two weeks, (iii) sensitivity observed with Lyoph-P&P is at least equal to, often better than, that observed with liquid formulation, (iv) validation of results observed with low-copy specimens is rendered easier by higher fluorescence level. In conclusion, Lyoph-P&P holds several advantages over extemporaneously preparer liquid formulation that merit to be considered when a novel real-time molecular assay is implemented in a laboratory in charge of routine diagnostic activity.',\n",
       " 'Rabies virus (RABV) is the only lyssavirus known to be present within the Caribbean. The island of Trinidad, is richly diverse in chiropteran fauna and endemic for bat-transmitted rabies with low RABV isolation rates observed in this population. We aimed to determine the seroprevalence of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (RVNA) in light of spatio-temporal and bat demographic factors to infer the extent of natural exposure to RABV in the Trinidadian bat population. RVNA titers were determined by the RABV micro-neutralization test on 383 bat samples representing 21 species, comprising 30.9% of local bat diversity, from 31 locations across the island over 5 years. RVNA was positively detected in 33 samples (8.6%) representing 6 bat species (mainly frugivorous) with titers ranging from 0.1 to 19 IU/mL (mean 1.66 IU/mL). The analyses based on a multivariable binomial generalised linear mixed-effects model showed that bat age and year of capture were significant predictors of seropositivity. Thus, juvenile bats were more likely to be seropositive when compared to adults (estimate 1.13; p = 0.04) which may suggest early exposure to the RABV with possible implications for viral amplification in this population. Temporal variation in rabies seropositivity, 2012â\\x80\\x932014 versus 2015â\\x80\\x932017 (estimate 1.07; p = 0.03) may have been related to the prevailing rabies epizootic situation. Regarding other factors investigated, RVNA was found in bats from both rural and non-rural areas, as well as in both hematophagous and non-hematophagous bat species. The most common seropositive species, Artibeus jamaicensis planirostris is ubiquitous throughout the island which may potentially facilitate human exposure. The findings of this study should be factored into public health assessments on the potential for rabies transmission by non-hematophagous bats in Trinidad.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression are common symptoms in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The 24-form Tai Chi may exert a protective function for CHD patients after PCI by improving anxiety and depression. METHODS: Patients who received PCI after 1â\\x80\\x934 days were randomly assigned to the 24-form Tai Chi group (TG) and the control group (CG). The differences in anxiety and depression, using the Medical Outcomes Study 36â\\x88\\x92item Shortâ\\x88\\x92Form Health Survey (SF-36), before and after an average of 10 months of Tai Chi intervention were compared in both groups to analyze the effects of Tai Chi on the emotion and the life quality of CHD patients. Meanwhile, the relative levels of miR-17-92 were measured by using real-time qPCR. The association between the relative levels of miR-17-92 and the anxiety and the depression of CHD patients after PCI was analyzed. Adjusted Cox models were used to explore the effect of Tai Chi exercise in CHD patients. RESULTS: After 10 months of intervention, the changes in the anxiety subscale (P = 0.002), in the depression subscale (P = 0.008), and in the stress (P = 0.015) scores were higher in the TG group when compared to those of the CG group. The proportion of anxious (P = 0.045) and depressed subjects (P = 0.042) in the TG group was lower than that in the CG group. On the other hand, the increase in the SF-36 scores and in the relative levels of miR-17-92 was significantly higher in the TG group when compared with that of the CG group (P < 0.05). The serum level of miR-17-92 had a negative correlation with the anxiety, the depression, and the stress scores (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The 24-form Tai Chi improved the anxiety and the depression symptoms and upregulated the miR-17-92 levels in CHD patients after PCI.',\n",

       " 'HIVâ\\x80\\x901 Tat is essential for HIVâ\\x80\\x901 replication and appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of HIVâ\\x80\\x90associated neurological complications. Secreted from infected or transfected cells, Tat has the extraordinary ability to cross the plasma membrane. In the brain, Tat can be taken up by CNS cells via receptorâ\\x80\\x90mediated endocytosis. Following endocytosis and its internalization into endolysosomes, Tat must be released in order for it to activate the HIVâ\\x80\\x901 LTR promoter and facilitate HIVâ\\x80\\x901 viral replication in the nucleus. However, the underlying mechanisms whereby Tat escapes endolysosomes remain unclear. Because Tat disrupts intracellular calcium homeostasis, we investigated the involvement of calcium in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation. We demonstrated that chelating endolysosome calcium with highâ\\x80\\x90affinity rhodamineâ\\x80\\x90dextran or chelating cytosolic calcium with BAPTAâ\\x80\\x90AM attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and LTR transactivation. Significantly, we demonstrated that pharmacologically blocking and knocking down the endolysosomeâ\\x80\\x90resident twoâ\\x80\\x90pore channels (TPCs) attenuated Tat endolysosome escape and LTR transactivation. This calciumâ\\x80\\x90mediated effect appears to be selective for TPCs because knocking down TRPML1 calcium channels was without effect. Our findings suggest that calcium released from TPCs is involved in Tat endolysosome escape and subsequent LTR transactivation. TPCs might represent a novel therapeutic target against HIVâ\\x80\\x901 infection and HIVâ\\x80\\x90associated neurological complications.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome continues to drive significant morbidity and mortality after severe trauma. The incidence of trauma-induced, moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia, according to the Berlin definition, could be as high as 45%. Its pathophysiology includes the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which propagate tissue injuries by triggering neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs include a DNA backbone coated with cytoplasmic proteins, which drive pulmonary cytotoxic effects. The structure of NETs and many DAMPs includes double-stranded DNA, which prevents their neutralization by plasma. Dornase alfa is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved recombinant DNase, which cleaves extracellular DNA and may therefore break up the backbone of NETs and DAMPs. Aerosolized dornase alfa was shown to reduce trauma-induced lung injury in experimental models and to improve arterial oxygenation in ventilated patients. METHODS: TRAUMADORNASE will be an institution-led, multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial in ventilated trauma patients. The primary trial objective is to demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia in severe trauma patients during the first 7 days from 45% to 30% by providing aerosolized dornase alfa as compared to placebo. The secondary objectives are to demonstrate an improvement in lung function and a reduction in morbidity and mortality. Randomization of 250 patients per treatment arm will be carried out through a secure, web-based system. Statistical analyses will include a descriptive step and an inferential step using fully Bayesian techniques. The study was approved by both the Agence Nationale de la SÃ©curitÃ© du MÃ©dicament et des Produits de SantÃ© (ANSM, on 5 October 2018) and a National Institutional Review Board (CPP, on 6 November 2018). Participant recruitment began in March 2019. Results will be published in international peer-reviewed medical journals. DISCUSSION: If early administration of inhaled dornase alfa actually reduces the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia in patients with severe trauma, this new therapeutic strategy may be easily implemented in many clinical trauma care settings. This treatment may facilitate ventilator weaning, reduce the burden of trauma-induced lung inflammation and facilitate recovery and rehabilitation in severe trauma patients.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) occur frequently in intensive care units (NICUs). The aim of this study was to analyze the results of surveillance of HAIs in a III level NICU in Naples, Italy during 2013â\\x80\\x932017 and to compare with those obtained during 2006â\\x80\\x932010. METHODS: The surveillance included 1265 neonates of all birth weight (BW) classes with > 2 days NICU stay. Infections were defined using standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions adapted to neonatal pathology. RESULTS: A total of 125 HAIs were registered during 2013â\\x80\\x932017 with a frequency of 9.9% and an incidence density of 3.2 per 1000 patient days. HAIs occurred in all BW classes with a decreasing trend from the lowest to the highest BW classes (p = < 0.001). Central line-associated blood stream infection (CLABSI) was the most frequent infection (69.6%), followed by ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) (20%), urinary tract infection (UTI) (8.8%) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (1.6%). Also, CLABSI and VAP incidence density decreased from lower to highest BW classes showing a significant trend (p = 0.007). Most frequent pathogens responsible for CLABSI were: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) (25.3%), Candida parapsilosis (21.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7), Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.8%). No microbiological diagnosis was achieved for 20.7% of CLABSI. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (20%), and CONS (20%) were the most frequent pathogens responsible for VAP. CLABSI incidence density showed no differences between 2006 and 2010 and 2013â\\x80\\x932017, while VAP incidence density for the 751â\\x80\\x93100 g BW class was higher during 2006â\\x80\\x932010 than during 2013â\\x80\\x932017 (p = 0.006). A higher incidence of the CLABSI caused by Gram positive bacteria (p = 0.002) or by undetermined etiology (p = 0.01) was observed during 2013â\\x80\\x932017 than during 2006â\\x80\\x932010, while a significant lower incidence of VAP caused by Gram-negative bacteria was found during 2013â\\x80\\x932017 than during 2006â\\x80\\x932010 (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: HAIs in the NICU developed in all BW classes with a decreasing trend from the lowest to the highest BW classes in both study periods. Differences in the aetiology of CLABSI and VAP were found between the two study periods. This reinforces the importance of HAIs surveillance protocol in the NICU, which monitors microbiological isolates and use of medical devices for all BW classes of neonates.',\n",
       " 'An increasing number of critically ill patients are immunocompromised. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (ARF), chiefly due to pulmonary infection, is the leading reason for ICU admission. Identifying the cause of ARF increases the chances of survival, but may be extremely challenging, as the underlying disease, treatments, and infection combine to create complex clinical pictures. In addition, there may be more than one infectious agent, and the pulmonary manifestations may be related to both infectious and non-infectious insults. Clinically or microbiologically documented bacterial pneumonia accounts for one-third of cases of ARF in immunocompromised patients. Early antibiotic therapy is recommended but decreases the chances of identifying the causative organism(s) to about 50%. Viruses are the second most common cause of severe respiratory infections. Positive tests for a virus in respiratory samples do not necessarily indicate a role for the virus in the current acute illness. Invasive fungal infections (Aspergillus, Mucorales, and Pneumocystis jirovecii) account for about 15% of severe respiratory infections, whereas parasites rarely cause severe acute infections in immunocompromised patients. This review focuses on the diagnosis of severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients. Special attention is given to newly validated diagnostic tests designed to be used on non-invasive samples or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and capable of increasing the likelihood of an early etiological diagnosis.

       " 'Abnormal levels of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO(2)) during resuscitation in the delivery suite are associated with intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) development. Our aim was to determine whether carbon dioxide (CO(2)) levels in the first 3 days after birth reflected abnormal EtCO(2) levels in the delivery suite, and hence, a prolonged rather than an early insult resulted in IVH. In addition, we determined if greater EtCO(2)level fluctuations during resuscitation occurred in infants who developed IVH. EtCO(2) levels during delivery suite resuscitation and CO(2) levels on the neonatal unit were evaluated in 58 infants (median gestational age 27.3 weeks). Delta EtCO(2) was the difference between the highest and lowest level of EtCO(2). Thirteen infants developed a grade 3â\\x80\\x934 IVH (severe group). There were no significant differences in CO(2) levels between those who did and did not develop an IVH (or severe IVH) on the NICU. The delta EtCO(2) during resuscitation differed between infants with any IVH (6.2 (5.4â\\x80\\x937.5) kPa) or no IVH (3.8 (2.7â\\x80\\x934.3) kPA) (p < 0.001) after adjusting for differences in gestational age. Delta EtCO(2) levels gave an area under the ROC curve of 0.940 for prediction of IVH. Conclusion: The results emphasize the importance of monitoring EtCO(2) levels in the delivery suite.',\n",

The induced temperature rise generated at these exposure parameters, hereafter termed thermal gradient, was measured and applied independently to cell suspensions in order to differentiate inactivation triggered by electric field (E-field) from heating. Treated cell suspensions were plated and cellular inactivation was quantified by colony counts after a 24-hour (h) incubation period. Additionally, cells from both exposure conditions were incubated with various antibiotic-soaked discs to determine if nsPEF exposure would induce changes in antibiotic susceptibility. Results indicate that, for both species, the total delivered energy (amplitude, pulse number and pulse duration) determined the magnitude of cell inactivation. Specifically, for 18.5 and 23.5 kV cm(â\\x88\\x921) exposures, L. acidophilus was more sensitive to the inactivation effects of nsPEF than E. coli, however, for the 13.5 kV cm(â\\x88\\x921) exposures E. coli was more sensitive, suggesting that L. acidophilus may need to meet an E-field threshold before significant inactivation can occur. Results also indicate that antibiotic susceptibility was enhanced by multiple nsPEF exposures, as observed by increased zones of growth inhibition. Moreover, for both species, a temperature increase of â\\x89¤ 20 Â°C (89% of exposures) was not sufficient to significantly alter cell inactivation, whereas none of the thermal equivalent exposures were sufficient to change antibiotic susceptibility categories.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Adults with chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, or lung disease are more likely to develop complications from a number of vaccine-preventable diseases, including influenza and pneumonia. In this study, we use the data from a chronic disease management information system in Shanghai to estimate vaccination coverage and characterize predictors of seasonal influenza and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) vaccination among people with chronic disease in Shanghai. METHODS: The Shanghai Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have information systems related to chronic disease management, hospital records, and immunizations. Data from individuals with hypertension, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were abstracted during July 2017. The main outcome was coverage of pneumococcal and influenza vaccination. Vaccination coverage was calculated across demographic groups. Significance in bivariate associations was assessed through Pearsonâ\\x80\\x99s chi-square tests, and in multivariable models through logistic regression models with a forward stepwise method to select variables. RESULTS: In the sample of 2,531,227 individuals â\\x89¥15 years, 22.8% were vaccinated for pneumonia from January 2013 to July 2017, and the vaccination coverage of influenza in the 2016/17 influenza season was 0.4%. Vaccination coverage was highest in those 70â\\x80\\x9379 and lowest in those younger than 60. Compared to urban areas, uptake in rural areas was higher for pneumonia vaccination (OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 2.41, 2.45), but lower for influenza vaccination (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.59). Having a greater number of chronic diseases was associated with higher likelihood of pneumonia vaccination (3 vs 1: OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.64, 1.71), but this relationship was not statistically significant for influenza vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: We found low levels with of pneumococcal vaccination, and extremely low uptake of influenza vaccination among individuals with high risk conditions in Shanghai who should be priority groups targeted for vaccination. Interventions could be designed to target groups with low uptake â\\x80\\x93 like younger adults, and individuals who have not yet retired.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Since the declaration of the 10th Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in DRC on 1st Aug 2018, several neighboring countries have been developing and implementing preparedness efforts to prevent EVD cross-border transmission to enable timely detection, investigation, and response in the event of a confirmed EVD outbreak in the country. We describe Ugandaâ\\x80\\x99s experience in EVD preparedness. RESULTS: On 4 August 2018, the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) activated the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC) and the National Task Force (NTF) for public health emergencies to plan, guide, and coordinate EVD preparedness in the country. The NTF selected an Incident Management Team (IMT), constituting a National Rapid Response Team (NRRT) that supported activation of the District Task Forces (DTFs) and District Rapid Response Teams (DRRTs) that jointly assessed levels of preparedness in 30 designated high-risk districts representing category 1 (20 districts) and category 2 (10 districts). The MoH, with technical guidance from the World Health Organisation (WHO), led EVD preparedness activities and worked together with other ministries and partner organisations to enhance community-based surveillance systems, develop and disseminate risk communication messages, engage communities, reinforce EVD screening and infection prevention measures at Points of Entry (PoEs) and in high-risk health facilities, construct and equip EVD isolation and treatment units, and establish coordination and procurement mechanisms. CONCLUSION: As of 31 May 2019, there was no confirmed case of EVD as Uganda has continued to make significant and verifiable progress in EVD preparedness. There is a need to sustain these efforts, not only in EVD preparedness but also across the entire spectrum of a multi-hazard framework. These efforts strengthen country capacity and compel the country to avail resources for preparedness and management of incidents at the source while effectively cutting costs of using a â\\x80\\x9cfire-fightingâ\\x80\\x9d approach during public health emergencies.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Birth asphyxia accounts for one-quarter newborn deaths. Providing quality care service of neonatal resuscitation reduces neonatal mortality. However, challenges to providing quality neonatal resuscitation are not well investigated in Ethiopia. Hence, this study is conducted to assess the quality provision of neonatal resuscitation in Ethiopia. METHOD: We used data from the Ethiopian 2016 Emergency Obstetric Newborn Care survey, conducted in 3804 health facilities providing maternal and newborn health services. We described the quality of neonatal resuscitation services according to the structure, process and outcome triad of quality dimension. Data from registers and birth records for the last 12 months prior to the survey were extracted. In each facility, the three last eligible charts of resuscitated neonates were reviewed and the highest frequency of chart of resuscitated baby was considered to the analysis. Thus, a total of 555 charts were assessed. Logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between the neonatal resuscitation processes, provider, facility and newborn characteristics with neonatal outcome at the time of discharge. RESULTS: The finding suggested that, around two-third, 364(65.6%) of the asphyxiated babies resuscitated by bag and mask type of neonatal resuscitation. Of the babies who had got neonatal resuscitation 463 (83.4%) survived. Resuscitated neonates with a gestational age of greater than 37 weeks and above (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) =1.82; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) (1.09â\\x80\\x933.04)), availability of priority equipment in health facilities for neonatal resuscitation (AOR = 1.24, 95% CI (1.09, 1.54)) and women who had 12 h and less duration of labor (AOR = 1.76; 95% CI (1.23, 3.13)) were the independent factors of survival of the neonate. CONCLUSION: Only half of the health facilities were ready for neonatal resuscitation (NR) in terms of priority equipmentâ\\x80\\x99s. However, eight out of ten babies survived after NR in Ethiopia. Gestational age, priority equipment for NR and duration of labor were determinants of survival of resuscitated neonates in Ethiopia.

       " 'BACKGROUND: The detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in the intensive care unit (ICU) presents several challenges, mainly associated to the clinical state of the patient. The presence of HIV infection further aggravates this scenario, requiring a reliable collection method, with better performance in the microbiological/molecular techniques to be used. We evaluated the performance of two methods for sample collection, mini bronchoalveolar lavage (Mini-BAL) and endotracheal aspirate (ETA), for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in critically ill patients. METHODS: This prospective study involved 26 HIV positive ICU internalized patients, with presumptive PTB who required mechanical ventilation. Two samples were obtained prospectively from 26 HIV ICU patients with presumptive PTB by Mini-BAL and ETA. The samples were processed for smear microscopy, LÃ¶wenstein-Jensen medium and the BACTEC Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube 960 systemÂ®. We define as confirmed PTB patients with positive MTB culture. Furthermore, all samples obtained through the Mini-BAL were analyzed by XpertÂ® MTB/RIF. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that the respiratory samples obtained by Mini-BAL were able to increase MTB detection in critically ill patients with presumptive PTB. The Mini-BAL allowed 30% increased recovery and guaranteed enough sample volume for processing in all methods. In addition, the larger volume of the samples obtained with this technique enabled the XpertÂ® MTB/RIF molecular test for diagnosis of TB. CONCLUSIONS: The Mini-BAL showed be an acceptable alternative to ETA in this population, since these critically ill and often-immunocompromised patients are more likely to develop complications related to invasive procedures.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Infections with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) pose a serious threat to patients with dysregulated immunity such as in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), but such infections have rarely been comprehensively characterized. Here, we present a fatal case of HLH secondary to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection complicated by both anti-viral drug resistance and sepsis from multiple MDROs including pandrug-resistant superbug bacteria. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy, six-year-old boy presented with a 45-day history of fever prior to a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and hemorrhagic colitis, both associated with CMV. On hospital admission, the patient was found to be colonized with multiple, multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and carbapenamase-producing organisms (CPO). He eventually developed respiratory, urine and bloodstream infections with highly drug-resistant, including pandrug-resistant bacteria, which could not be controlled by antibiotic treatment. Antiviral therapy also failed to contain his CMV infection and the patient succumbed to overwhelming bacterial and viral infection. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the MDR bacteria and metagenomic analysis of his blood sample revealed an unusual accumulation of a wide range of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in a single patient, including antiviral resistance to ganciclovir, and resistance mechanisms to all currently available antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The case highlights both the risk of acquiring MDR superbugs and the severity of these infections in HLH patients.',\n",
       " 'Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections are wide-spread among the general population with manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to severe developmental disabilities in newborns and life-threatening illnesses in individuals with a compromised immune system. Nearly all current drugs suffer from one or more limitations, which emphasizes the critical need to develop new approaches and new molecules. We reasoned that a â\\x80\\x98poly-pharmacyâ\\x80\\x99 approach relying on simultaneous binding to multiple receptors involved in HCMV entry into host cells could pave the way to a more effective therapeutic outcome. This work presents the study of a synthetic, small molecule displaying pleiotropicity of interactions as a competitive antagonist of viral or cell surface receptors including heparan sulfate proteoglycans and heparan sulfate-binding proteins, which play important roles in HCMV entry and spread. Sulfated pentagalloylglucoside (SPGG), a functional mimetic of heparan sulfate, inhibits HCMV entry into human foreskin fibroblasts and neuroepithelioma cells with high potency. At the same time, SPGG exhibits no toxicity at levels as high as 50-fold more than its inhibition potency. Interestingly, cell-ELISA assays showed downregulation in HCMV immediate-early gene 1 and 2 (IE 1&2) expression in presence of SPGG further supporting inhibition of viral entry. Finally, HCMV foci were observed to decrease significantly in the presence of SPGG suggesting impact on viral spread too. Overall, this work offers the first evidence that pleiotropicity, such as demonstrated by SPGG, may offer a new poly-therapeutic approach toward effective inhibition of HCMV.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The current national influenza vaccination schedule in Mexico does not recommend vaccination in the school-aged population (5â\\x80\\x9311 years). Currently, there are limited data from middle-income countries analysing the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination in this population. We explored the clinical effects and economic benefits of expanding the current national influenza vaccination schedule in Mexico to include the school-aged population. METHODS: A static 1-year model incorporating herd effect was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of expanding the current national influenza vaccination schedule of Mexico to include the school-aged population. We performed a cross-sectional epidemiological study using influenza records (2009â\\x80\\x932018), death records (2010â\\x80\\x932015), and discharge and hospitalisation records (2010â\\x80\\x932016), from the databases of Mexicoâ\\x80\\x99s Influenza Surveillance System (SISVEFLU), the National Mortality Epidemiological and Statistical System (SEED), and the Automated Hospital Discharge System (SAEH), respectively. Cost estimates for influenza cases were based on 7 scenarios using data analysed from SISVEFLU; assumptions for clinical management of cases were defined according to Mexicoâ\\x80\\x99s national clinical guidelines. The primary health outcome for this study was the number of influenza cases avoided. A sensitivity analysis was performed using conservative and optimistic parameters (vaccination coverage: 30% / 70%, Vaccine effectiveness: 19% / 68%). RESULTS: It was estimated that expanding the influenza immunisation programme to cover school-aged population in Mexico over the 2018â\\x80\\x932019 influenza season would result in 671,461 cases of influenza avoided (50% coverage and 50% effectiveness assumed). Associated with this were 262,800 fewer outpatient consultations; 154,100 fewer emergency room consultations; 97,600 fewer hospitalisations, and 15 fewer deaths. Analysis of cases avoided by age-group showed that 55.4% of them were in the school-aged population, and the decrease in outpatient consultations was largest in this population. There was an overall decrease in the economic burden for the Mexican health care system of 111.9 million US dollars; the immunization programme was determined to be cost-saving in the base, conservative and optimistic scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating school-aged population in Mexico would be cost-effective; expansion of the current national vaccination schedule to this age group is supported.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: A noticeable interest in ketamine infusion for sedation management has developed among critical care physicians for critically ill patients. The 2018 Pain, Agitation/sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep disruption guideline suggested low-dose ketamine infusion as an adjunct to opioid therapy to reduce opioid requirements in post-surgical patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). This was, however, rated as conditional due to the very low quality of evidence. Ketamine has favorable characteristics, making it an especially viable alternative for patients with respiratory and hemodynamic instability. The Analgo-sedative adjuncT keTAmine Infusion iN Mechanically vENTilated ICU patients (ATTAINMENT) trial aims to assess the effect and safety of adjunct low-dose continuous infusion of ketamine as an analgo-sedative compared to standard of care in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) for â\\x89¥ 24 h. METHODS/DESIGN: This trial is a prospective, randomized, active controlled, open-label, pilot, feasibility study of adult ICU patients (> 14 years old) on MV. The study will take place in the adult ICUs in the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and will enroll 80 patients. Patients will be randomized post-intubation into two groups: the intervention group will receive an adjunct low-dose continuous infusion of ketamine plus standard of care. Ketamine will be administered over a period of 48 h at a fixed infusion rate of 2 Î¼g/kg/min (0.12 mg/kg/h) in the first 24 h followed by 1 Î¼g/kg/min (0.06 mg/kg/h) in the second 24 h. The control group will receive standard of care in the ICU (propofol and/or fentanyl and/or midazolam) according to the KFSH&RC sedation and analgesia protocol as clinically appropriate. The primary outcome is MV duration until ICU discharge, death, extubation, or 28 days post-randomization, whichever comes first. DISCUSSION: The first patient was enrolled on 1 September 2019. As of 10 October 2019, a total of 16 patients had been enrolled. We expect to complete the recruitment by 31 December 2020. The findings of this pilot trial will likely justify further investigation for the role of adjunct low-dose ketamine infusion as an analgo-sedative agent in a larger, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Drug safety assessments in clinical trials present unique analytical challenges. Some of these include adjusting for individual follow-up time, repeated measurements of multiple outcomes and missing data among others. Furthermore, pre-specifying appropriate analysis becomes difficult as some safety endpoints are unexpected. Although existing guidelines such as CONSORT encourage thorough reporting of adverse events (AEs) in clinical trials, they provide limited details for safety data analysis. The limited guidelines may influence suboptimal analysis by failing to account for some analysis challenges above. A typical example where such challenges exist are trials of anti-malarial drugs for malaria prevention during pregnancy. Lack of proper standardized evaluation of the safety of antimalarial drugs has limited the ability to draw conclusions about safety. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to establish the current practice in statistical analysis for preventive antimalarial drug safety in pregnancy. METHODS: The search included five databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Malaria in Pregnancy Library and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) to identify original English articles reporting Phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on anti-malarial drugs for malaria prevention in pregnancy published from January 2010 to July 2019. RESULTS: Eighteen trials were included in this review that collected multiple longitudinal safety outcomes including AEs. Statistical analysis and reporting of the safety outcomes in all the trials used descriptive statistics; proportions/counts (n = 18, 100%) and mean/median (n = 2, 11.1%). Results presentation included tabular (n = 16, 88.9%) and text description (n = 2, 11.1%). Univariate inferential methods were reported in most trials (n = 16, 88.9%); including Chi square/Fisherâ\\x80\\x99s exact test (n = 12, 66.7%), t test (n = 2, 11.1%) and Mannâ\\x80\\x93Whitney/Wilcoxon test (n = 1, 5.6%). Multivariable methods, including Poisson and negative binomial were reported in few trials (n = 3, 16.7%). Assessment of a potential link between missing efficacy data and safety outcomes was not reported in any of the trials that reported efficacy missing data (n = 7, 38.9%). CONCLUSION: The review demonstrated that statistical analysis of safety data in anti-malarial drugs for malarial chemoprevention in pregnancy RCTs is inadequate. The analyses insufficiently account for multiple safety outcomes potential dependence, follow-up time and informative missing data which can compromise anti-malarial drug safety evidence development, based on the available data.',\n",

Acute Exacerbation of COPD: Recommendations: NIV should be used in management of acute exacerbation of COPD in patients with acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis (pH = 7.25-7.35). (1A) NIV should be attempted in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD (pH <7.25 & PaCO2 â\\x89¥ 45) before initiating invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) except in patients requiring immediate intubation. (2A). Lower the pH higher the chance of failure of NIV. (2B) NIV should not to be used routinely in normo- or mildly hyper-capneic patients with acute exacerbation of COPD, without acidosis (pH > 7.35). (2B) A2. NIV in ARF due to Chest wall deformities/Neuromuscular diseases: Recommendations: NIV may be used in patients of ARF due to chest wall deformity/Neuromuscular diseases. (PaCO2 â\\x89¥ 45) (UPP) A3. NIV in ARF due to Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS): Recommendations: NIV may be used in AHRF in OHS patients when they present with acute hypercapnic or acute on chronic respiratory failure (pH 45). (3B) NIV/CPAP may be used in obese, hypercapnic patients with OHS and/or right heart failure in the absence of acidosis. (UPP) B. NIV IN ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: B1. NIV in Acute Cardiogenic Pulmonary Oedema: Recommendations: NIV is recommended in hospital patients with ARF, due to Cardiogenic pulmonary edema. (1A). NIV should be used in patients with acute heart failure/ cardiogenic pulmonary edema, right from emergency department itself. (1B) Both CPAP and BiPAP modes are safe and effective in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. (1A). However, BPAP (NIV-PS) should be preferred in cardiogenic pulmonary edema with hypercapnia. (3A) B2. NIV in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: Recommendations: NIV may be used over conventional oxygen therapy in mild early acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (P/F ratio <300 and >200 mmHg), under close supervision. (2B) We strongly recommend against a trial of NIV in patients with acute hypoxemic failure with P/F ratio <150. (2A) B3. NIV in ARF due to Chest Trauma: Recommendations: NIV may be used in traumatic flail chest along with adequate pain relief. (3B) B4. NIV in Immunocompromised Host: Recommendations: In Immunocompromised patients with early ARF, we may consider NIV over conventional oxygen. (2B). B5. NIV in Palliative Care: Recommendations: We strongly recommend use of NIV for reducing dyspnea in palliative care setting. (2A) B6. NIV in post-operative cases: Recommendations: NIV should be used in patients with post-operative acute respiratory failure. (2A) B6a. NIV in abdominal surgery: Recommendations: NIV may be used in patients with ARF following abdominal surgeries. (2A) B6b. NIV in bariatric surgery: Recommendations: NIV may be used in post-bariatric surgery patients with pre-existent OSA or OHS. (3A) B6c. NIV in Thoracic surgery: Recommendations: In cardiothoracic surgeries, use of NIV is recommended post operatively for acute respiratory failure to improve oxygenation and reduce chance of reintubation. (2A) NIV should not be used in patients undergoing esophageal surgery. (UPP) B6d. NIV in post lung transplant: Recommendations: NIV may be used for shortening weaning time and to avoid re-intubation following lung transplantation. (2B) B7. NIV during Procedures (ETI/Bronchoscopy/TEE/Endoscopy): Recommendations: NIV may be used for pre-oxygenation before intubation. (2B) NIV with appropriate interface may be used in patients of ARF during Bronchoscopy/Endoscopy to improve oxygenation. (3B) B8. NIV in Viral Pneumonitis ARDS: Recommendations: NIV cannot be considered as a treatment of choice for patients with acute respiratory failure with H1N1 pneumonia. However, it may be reasonable to use NIV in selected patients with single organ involvement, in a strictly controlled environment with close monitoring. (2B) B9. NIV and Acute exacerbation of Pulmonary Tuberculosis: Recommendations: Careful use of NIV in patients with acute Tuberculosis may be considered, with effective infection control precautions to prevent air-borne transmission. (3B) B10. NIV after planned extubation in high risk patients: Recommendation: We recommend that NIV may be used to wean high risk patients from invasive mechanical ventilation as it reduces re-intubation rate. (2B) B11. NIV for respiratory distress post extubation: Recommendations: We recommend that NIV therapy should not be used to manage respiratory distress post-extubation in high risk patients. (2B) C. APPLICATION OF NIV: Recommendation: Choice of mode should be mainly decided by factors like disease etiology and severity, the breathing effort by the patient and the operator familiarity and experience. (UPP) We suggest using flow trigger over pressure triggering in assisted modes, as it provides better patient ventilator synchrony. Especially in COPD patients, flow triggering has been found to benefit auto PEEP. (3B) D. MANAGEMENT OF PATIENT ON NIV: D1. Sedation: Recommendations: A non-pharmacological approach to calm the patient (Reassuring the patient, proper environment) should always be tried before administrating sedatives. (UPP) In patients on NIV, sedation may be used with extremely close monitoring and only in an ICU setting with lookout for signs of NIV failure. (UPP) E. EQUIPMENT: Recommendations: We recommend that portable bilevel ventilators or specifically designed ICU ventilators with non-invasive mode should be used for delivering Nonâ\\x80\\x93invasive ventilation in critically ill patients. (UPP) Both critical care ventilators with leak compensation and bi-level ventilators have been equally effective in decreasing the WOB, RR, and PaCO2. (3B) Currently, Oronasal mask is the most preferred interface for non-invasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure. (3B) F.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD). Its prevalence in swine herds was first reported in China in 2000. PCV2 infection causes immunosuppression that leads to multiple diseases, causing serious economic problems for the swine industry in China. Since information on the genetic variation of PCV2 in Yunnan province is limited, this study aims to investigate the molecular epidemiological and evolutionary characteristics of PCV2 from 2016 to 2019. METHODS: A total of 279 clinical samples were collected from different regions of Yunnan between 2016 to 2019, and PCV2 was detected by PCR. We then amplified full genomes from the positive samples, and the sequences were analysed for homology and genetic evolution. RESULTS: Overall, 60.93% (170/279) of the screened swine herd samples were positive for PCV2. We sequenced 15 Yunnan province PCV2 strains from positive samples. Analyses of the complete genomes and Cap genes led to the classification of the 15 Yunnan PCV2 strains into PCV2a (2 of 15), PCV2b (1of 15) and PCV2d (12 of 15). All strains shared 94.3â\\x80\\x9399.9% of their identities with the nucleotide sequences of complete genomes in this study and shared 94.2â\\x80\\x9399.9% identity with the reference sequences. All strains share 89.4â\\x80\\x93100% and 86.8â\\x80\\x93100% of their identities with the nucleotide and amino acid (aa) sequences of Cap, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide evidence that PCV2a, PCV2b and PCV2d genotypes coexisted in Yunnan Province from 2016 to 2019, and the priority prevalence genotype was PCV2d. The data provide evidence for the increased genetic diversity and insights into the molecular epidemiology of PCV2. This study also provides basic data for the Yunnan province PCV2 molecular epidemiological survey and accumulates effective materials for the development of PCV2 vaccines.',\n",

With the relentless effort of studies, researchers have explored the role of ROS in biosystem and various diseases. ROS are beneficial for biosystem presenting as signalling molecules and enhancing immunologic defence. However, they also have harmful effects such as causing tissue and organ damages. The results are controversial in studies focusing on ROS and ROS-related diseases by regulating ROS with inhibitors or promotors. These competing results hindered the process for further investigation of the specific mechanisms lying behind. The opinions presented in this review interpret the researches of ROS from a different dimension that might explain the competing results of ROS introduced so far from a broader perspective.

Because the MDSâ\\x80\\x93AL risk has also been shown to be associated with exposure to GCSF, since 2005, in France, patients receiving high daily GCSF doses (>15 Î¼g/kg/day) are eligible for HSCT, in addition to classic indications (MDSâ\\x80\\x93AL or GCSF refractoriness). We analyzed the effect of this policy. Among 144 prospectively followed ELANE-neutropenia patients enrolled in the French Severe Congenital Neutropenia Registry, we defined two groups according to period: â\\x80\\x9cbefore 2005â\\x80\\x9d for those born before 2005 and followed until 31/12/2004 (1588 person-years); and â\\x80\\x9cafter 2005â\\x80\\x9d comprised of those born after 2005 or born before 2005 but followed after 2005 until 31/03/2019 (1327 person-years).

       " 'Vitamin D testing and the use of vitamin D supplements have increased substantially in recent years. Currently, the role of vitamin D supplementation, and the optimal vitamin D dose and status, is a subject of debate, because large interventional studies have been unable to show a clear benefit (in mostly vitamin D replete populations). This may be attributed to limitations in trial design, as most studies did not meet the basic requirements of a nutrient intervention study, including vitamin D-replete populations, too small sample sizes, and inconsistent intervention methods regarding dose and metabolites. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 50 nmol/L or 20 ng/ml) is associated with unfavorable skeletal outcomes, including fractures and bone loss. A 25(OH)D level of >50 nmol/L or 20 ng/ml is, therefore, the primary treatment goal, although some data suggest a benefit for a higher threshold. Severe vitamin D deficiency with a 25(OH)D concentration below <30 nmol/L (or 12 ng/ml) dramatically increases the risk of excess mortality, infections, and many other diseases, and should be avoided whenever possible. The data on a benefit for mortality and prevention of infections, at least in severely deficient individuals, appear convincing. Vitamin D is clearly not a panacea, and is most likely efficient only in deficiency. Given its rare side effects and its relatively wide safety margin, it may be an important, inexpensive, and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases, but future large and well-designed studies should evaluate this further. A worldwide public health intervention that includes vitamin D supplementation in certain risk groups, and systematic vitamin D food fortification to avoid severe vitamin D deficiency, would appear to be important. In this narrative review, the current international literature on vitamin D deficiency, its relevance, and therapeutic options is discussed.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: The effect of renal replacement therapy (RRT) on the outcomes of severe acute kidney injury (AKI) after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the association of RRT with 6-month mortality in patients with severe AKI treated with targeted temperature management (TTM) after OHCA. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected multicentre observational cohort study that included adult OHCA patients treated with TTM across 22 hospitals in South Korea between October 2015 and December 2018. AKI was diagnosed using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. The primary outcome was 6-month mortality and the secondary outcome was cerebral performance category (CPC) at 6 months. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to define the role of RRT in stage 3 AKI. RESULTS: Among 10,426 patients with OHCA, 1373 were treated with TTM. After excluding those who died within 48 h of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and those with pre-arrest chronic kidney disease, our study cohort comprised 1063 patients. AKI developed in 590 (55.5%) patients and 223 (21.0%) had stage 3 AKI. Among them, 115 (51.6%) were treated with RRT. The most common treatment modality among RRT patients was continuous renal replacement therapy (111 [96.5%]), followed by intermittent haemodialysis (4 [3.5%]). The distributions of CPC (1â\\x80\\x935) at 6 months for the non-RRT vs. the RRT group were 3/108 (2.8%) vs. 12/115 (10.4%) for CPC 1, 0/108 (0.0%) vs. 1/115 (0.9%) for CPC 2, 1/108 (0.9%) vs. 3/115 (2.6%) for CPC 3, 6/108 (5.6%) vs. 6/115 (5.2%) for CPC 4, and 98/108 (90.7%) vs. 93/115 (80.9%) for CPC 5, respectively (P = 0.01). The RRT group had significantly lower 6-month mortality than the non-RRT group (93/115 [81%] vs. 98/108 [91%], P = 0.04). Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that RRT was independently associated with a lower risk of death in patients with stage 3 AKI (hazard ratio, 0.569 [95% confidence interval, 0.377â\\x80\\x930.857, P = 0.01]).

       " 'BACKGROUND: Tuberculous pleurisy (TBP) is the most common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB). However, rapid diagnostic methods with high accuracy for tuberculous pleurisy are urgently needed. In the present study, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF, LAMP and SAT-TB assay with pleural fluids from culture-positive TBP patients. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 300 patients with exudative pleural effusions used as the samples for Xpert MTB/RIF, LAMP and SAT-TB assay. Of these, 265 including 223 patients diagnosed with TBP and 42 non-TBP patients used as controls were analyzed. RESULTS: The sensitivities of Xpert MTB/RIF (27.4%), LAMP (26.5%) and SAT-TB assay (32.3%) were significantly higher than that of pleural effusion smear (14.3%, X(2) = 20.65, P < 0.001), whereas they were much lower than expected for the analysis of pleural effusion samples. Both SAT-TB assay and Xpert MTB/RIF demonstrated high specificities (100%) and PPVs (100%), but the NPVs of all of the tests were < 22%. The area under ROC curve of pleural effusion smear, LAMP, Xpert MTB/RIF and SAT-TB assays was 0.524 (95% CI 0.431â\\x80\\x930.617), 0.632 (95% CI 0.553â\\x80\\x930.71), 0.637 (95% CI 0.56â\\x80\\x930.714) and 0.673 (95% CI 0.6â\\x80\\x930.745). SAT-TB assays had the highest AUC. CONCLUSION: Nucleic acid amplification tests are not the first choice in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy. In this type of test, SAT-TB is recommended because of its low cost, relatively more accurate compared with the other two tests.

Generally, V. parahaemolyticus recovered from the environment and/or seafood is thought to be non-pathogenic and the relationship between environmental isolates and acute diarrhoeal disease is poorly understood. In this study, we explored the virulence potential of environmental V. parahaemolyticus isolated from water, plankton and assorted seafood samples collected from the Indian coast. RESULTS: Twenty-two V. parahaemolyticus isolates from seafood harboured virulence associated genes encoding the thermostable-direct haemolysin (TDH), TDH-related haemolysin (TRH), and Type 3 secretion systems (T3SS) and 95.5% of the toxigenic isolates had pandemic strain attributes (toxRS/new(+)). Nine serovars, with pandemic strain traits were newly identified and an O4:K36 tdh(â\\x88\\x92)trh(+)V. parahaemolyticus bearing pandemic marker gene was recognised for the first time. Results obtained by reverse transcription PCR showed trh, T3SS1 and T3SS2Î² to be functional in the seafood isolates. Moreover, the environmental strains were cytotoxic and could invade Caco-2 cells upon infection as well as induce changes to the tight junction protein, ZO-1 and the actin cytoskeleton. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that environmental isolates of V. parahaemolyticus are potentially invasive and capable of eliciting pathogenic characteristics typical of clinical strains and present a potential health risk. We also demonstrate that virulence of this pathogen is highly complex and hence draws attention for the need to investigate more reliable virulence markers in order to distinguish the environmental and clinical isolates, which will be crucial for the pathogenomics and control of this pathogen.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Several studies have found only a weak to moderate correlation between oxygenation and lung aeration in response to changes in PEEP. This study aimed to investigate the association between changes in shunt, low and high ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, and computed tomography-measured lung aeration following an increase in PEEP in patients with ARDS. METHODS: In this preliminary study, 12 ARDS patients were subjected to recruitment maneuvers followed by setting PEEP at 5 and then either 15 or 20 cmH(2)O. Lung aeration was measured by computed tomography. Values of pulmonary shunt and low and high V/Q mismatch were calculated by a model-based method from measurements of oxygenation, ventilation, and metabolism taken at different inspired oxygen levels and an arterial blood gas sample. RESULTS: Increasing PEEP resulted in reduced values of pulmonary shunt and the percentage of non-aerated tissue, and an increased percentage of normally aerated tissue (p < 0.05). Changes in shunt and normally aerated tissue were significantly correlated (r = â\\x88\\x92 0.665, p = 0.018). Three distinct responses to increase in PEEP were observed in values of shunt and V/Q mismatch: a beneficial response in seven patients, where shunt decreased without increasing high V/Q; a detrimental response in four patients where both shunt and high V/Q increased; and a detrimental response in a patient with reduced shunt but increased high V/Q mismatch. Non-aerated tissue decreased with increased PEEP in all patients, and hyperinflated tissue increased only in patients with a detrimental response in shunt and V/Q mismatch. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that improved lung aeration following an increase in PEEP is not always consistent with reduced shunt and V/Q mismatch. Poorly matched redistribution of ventilation and perfusion, between dependent and non-dependent regions of the lung, may explain why patients showed detrimental changes in shunt and V/Q mismatch on increase in PEEP, despite improved aeration.

       " 'National policy on global health (NPGH) arenas are multisectoral governing arrangements for cooperation between health, development, and foreign affairs sectors in government policy for global health governance. To explore the relationship between national and global processes for governing global health, this paper asks: in what forms of interaction between NPGH arenas and global health governance are learning and networking processes present? In a multiple case study of Norwegian and Swiss NPGH arenas, we collected data on intersectoral policy processes from semi-structured interviews with 33 informants in 2014-2015. Adapting Real-Datoâ\\x80\\x99s framework, we analyzed each case separately, producing monographs for comparing NPGH arenas. Analyzing both NPGH arenas for relational structures linking external resources to internal policy arena processes, we found five zones of interactions - including institutions, transgovernmental clubs, and connective forms. These interactions circulate ideas and soften arenasâ\\x80\\x99 boundaries. We argue that NPGH is characteristic of transnational governance of global health.

       " 'The detection of pathogen-specific antibodies remains a cornerstone of clinical diagnostics. Yet, many test exhibit undesirable performance or are completely lacking. Given this, we developed serum epitope repertoire analysis (SERA), a method to rapidly discover conserved, pathogen-specific antigens and their epitopes, and applied it to develop an assay for Chagas disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Antibody binding peptide motifs were identified from 28 Chagas repertoires using a bacterial display random 12-mer peptide library and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Thirty-three motifs were selected and mapped to candidate Chagas antigens. In a blinded validation set (n = 72), 30/30 Chagas were positive, 30/30 non-Chagas were negative, and 1/12 Leishmania sp. was positive. After unblinding, a Leishmania cross-reactive epitope was identified and removed from the panel. The Chagas assay exhibited 100% sensitivity (30/30) and specificity (90/90) in a second blinded validation set including individuals with other parasitic infections. Amongst additional epitope repertoires with unknown Chagas serostatus, assay specificity was 99.8% (998/1000). Thus, the Chagas assay achieved a combined sensitivity and specificity equivalent or superior to diagnostic algorithms that rely on three separate tests to achieve high specificity. NGS-based serology via SERA provides an effective approach to discover antigenic epitopes and develop high performance multiplex serological assays.',\n",
       " 'STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this manuscript is to describe the development process of the data set for the National Spinal Cord Injury Registry of Iran (NSCIR-IR). SETTING: SCI community in Iran. METHODS: The NSCIR-IR data set was developed in 8 months, from March 2015 to October 2015. An expert panel of 14 members was formed. After a review of data sets of similar registries in developed countries, the selection and modification of the basic framework were performed over 16 meetings, based on the objectives and feasibility of the registry. RESULTS: The final version of the data set was composed of 376 data elements including sociodemographic, hospital admission, injury incidence, prehospital procedures, emergency department visit, medical history, vertebral injury, spinal cord injury details, interventions, complications, and discharge data. It also includes 163 components of the International Standards for the Neurologic Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) and 65 data elements related to quality of life, pressure ulcers, pain, and spasticity. CONCLUSION: The NSCIR-IR data set was developed in order to meet the quality improvement objectives of the registry. The process was centered around choosing the data elements assessing care provided to individuals in the acute and chronic phases of SCI in hospital settings. The International Spinal Cord Injury Data Set was selected as a basic framework, helped by comparison with data from other countries. Expert panel modifications facilitated the implementation of the registry process with the current clinical workflow in hospitals.',\n",
       " 'Mayaro virus (MAYV) is endemic in South American countries where it is responsible for sporadic outbreaks of acute febrile illness. The hallmark of MAYV infection is a highly debilitating and chronic arthralgia. Although MAYV emergence is a potential threat, there are no specific therapies or licensed vaccine. In this study, we developed a murine model of MAYV infection that emulates many of the most relevant clinical features of the infection in humans and tested a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate (MAYV/IRES). Intraplantar inoculation of a WT strain of MAYV into immunocompetent mice induced persistent hypernociception, transient viral replication in target organs, systemic production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and specific humoral IgM and IgG responses. Inoculation of MAYV/IRES in BALB/c mice induced strong specific cellular and humoral responses. Moreover, MAYV/IRES vaccination of immunocompetent and interferon receptor-defective mice resulted in protection from disease induced by the virulent wt MAYV strain. Thus, this study describes a novel model of MAYV infection in immunocompetent mice and highlights the potential role of a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate in hostâ\\x80\\x99s protection from disease induced by a virulent MAYV strain.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Ventilation/perfusion inequalities impair gas exchange in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although increased dead-space ventilation (V(D)/V(T)) has been described in ARDS, its mechanism is not clearly understood. We sought to evaluate the relationships between dynamic variations in V(D)/V(T) and extra-pulmonary microcirculatory blood flow detected at sublingual mucosa hypothesizing that an altered microcirculation, which is a generalized phenomenon during severe inflammatory conditions, could influence ventilation/perfusion mismatching manifested by increases in V(D)/V(T) fraction during early stages of ARDS. METHODS: Forty-two consecutive patients with early moderate and severe ARDS were included. PEEP was set targeting the best respiratory-system compliance after a PEEP-decremental recruitment maneuver. After 60 min of stabilization, hemodynamics and respiratory mechanics were recorded and blood gases collected. V(D)/V(T) was calculated from the CO(2) production ([Formula: see text] ) and CO(2) exhaled fraction ([Formula: see text] ) measurements by volumetric capnography. Sublingual microcirculatory images were simultaneously acquired using a sidestream dark-field device for an ulterior blinded semi-quantitative analysis. All measurements were repeated 24 h after. RESULTS: Percentage of small vessels perfused (PPV) and microcirculatory flow index (MFI) were inverse and significantly related to V(D)/V(T) at baseline (Spearmanâ\\x80\\x99s rho = â\\x88\\x92 0.76 and â\\x88\\x92 0.63, p < 0.001; R(2) = 0.63, and 0.48, p < 0.001, respectively) and 24 h after (Spearmanâ\\x80\\x99s rho = â\\x88\\x92 0.71, and â\\x88\\x92 0.65; p < 0.001; R(2) = 0.66 and 0.60, p < 0.001, respectively). Other respiratory, macro-hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters did not correlate with V(D)/V(T). Variations in PPV between baseline and 24 h were inverse and significantly related to simultaneous changes in V(D)/V(T) (Spearmanâ\\x80\\x99s rho = â\\x88\\x92 0.66, p < 0.001; R(2) = 0.67, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Increased heterogeneity of microcirculatory blood flow evaluated at sublingual mucosa seems to be related to increases in V(D)/V(T), while respiratory mechanics and oxygenation parameters do not. Whether there is a causeâ\\x80\\x93effect relationship between microcirculatory dysfunction and dead-space ventilation in ARDS should be addressed in future research.',\n",
       " 'Global transport and communication networks enable information, ideas, and infectious diseases to now spread at speeds far beyond what has historically been possible. To effectively monitor, design, or intervene in such epidemic-like processes, there is a need to predict the speed of a particular contagion in a particular network, and to distinguish between nodes that are more likely to become infected sooner or later during an outbreak. Here, we study these quantities using a message-passing approach to derive simple and effective predictions that are validated against epidemic simulations on a variety of real-world networks with good agreement. In addition to individualized predictions for different nodes, we find an overall sudden transition from low density to almost full network saturation as the contagion progresses in time. Our theory is developed and explained in the setting of simple contagions on treelike networks, but we are also able to show how the method extends remarkably well to complex contagions and highly clustered networks.',\n",

       " '[Image: see text] Vaccines have had a profound impact on the management and prevention of infectious disease. In addition, the development of vaccines against chronic diseases has attracted considerable interest as an approach to prevent, rather than treat, conditions such as cancer, Alzheimerâ\\x80\\x99s disease, and others. Subunit vaccines consist of nongenetic components of the infectious agent or disease-related epitope. In this Review, we discuss peptide-based vaccines and their potential in three therapeutic areas: infectious disease, Alzheimerâ\\x80\\x99s disease, and cancer. We discuss factors that contribute to vaccine efficacy and how these parameters may potentially be modulated by design. We examine both clinically tested vaccines as well as nascent approaches and explore current challenges and potential remedies. While peptide vaccines hold substantial promise in the prevention of human disease, many obstacles remain that have hampered their clinical use; thus, continued research efforts to address these challenges are warranted.',\n",
       " 'Influenza viruses infect millions of people around the globe annually, usually causing self-limited upper respiratory tract infections. However, a small but non-negligible proportion of patients suffer from life-threatening pulmonary disease. Those affected include otherwise healthy individuals, and children with primary infections in particular. Much effort has been devoted to virological studies of influenza and vaccine development. By contrast, the enormous interindividual variability in susceptibility to influenza has received very little attention. One interesting hypothesis is that interindividual variability is driven largely by the genetic makeup of the infected patients. Unbiased genomic approaches have been used to search for genetic lesions in children with life-threatening pulmonary influenza. Four monogenic causes of severe influenza pneumonitisâ\\x80\\x94deficiencies of GATA2, IRF7, IRF9, and TLR3â\\x80\\x94have provided evidence that severe influenza pneumonitis can be genetic and often in patients with no other severe infections. These deficiencies highlight the importance of human type I and III IFN-mediated immunity for host defense against influenza. Clinical penetrance is incomplete, and the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood. However, human genetic studies have clearly revealed that seemingly sporadic and isolated life-threatening influenza pneumonitis in otherwise healthy individuals can be genetic.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Severe pneumonia caused by influenza virus infection can be secondary to invasive pulmonary fungal (IPF) infection. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to summarize the incidence of IPF infection secondary to influenza virus infection and further explore its etiologic mechanism and high-risk factors. METHODS: All adult patients with confirmed influenza A (H1N1) virus infection admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of Nanjing Drum Hospital from November 2017 to March 2018 were retrospectively selected. The differences in baseline factors, risk factors, immune function and outcome parameters were studied between patients with and without IPF. RESULTS: Of the 19 critically ill patients with H1N1 infection, 11 (57.9%) developed IPF infection after 7 days of ICU admission. Two patients had proven and nine probable IPF infection. A difference in human leukocyte antigenâ\\x80\\x93DR isotype (â\\x96³HLA-DR; day 7â\\x80\\x93day 1) was found between the two groups. â\\x96³HLA-DR (day 7â\\x80\\x93day 1) was higher in patients with no IPF infection than in those with IPF infection [(14.52 Â± 14.21)% vs ( â\\x88\\x92 11.74 Â± 20.22)%, P = 0.019]. The decline in HLA-DR indicated impaired immune function secondary to fungal infection in patients with H1N1 infection. CONCLUSIONS: IPF infection was diagnosed in 57.9% of critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection after a median of 7 days following ICU admission. A continuous decline in immune function could lead to the development of IPF infections. Dynamic monitoring of immune function may help in the early detection of IPF infection.',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVES: To develop evidence-based recommendations for clinicians caring for children (including infants, school-aged children, and adolescents) with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. DESIGN: A panel of 49 international experts, representing 12 international organizations, as well as three methodologists and three public members was convened. Panel members assembled at key international meetings (for those panel members attending the conference), and a stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in November 2018. A formal conflict-of-interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among the chairs, co-chairs, methodologists, and group heads, as well as within subgroups, served as an integral part of the guideline development process. METHODS: The panel consisted of six subgroups: recognition and management of infection, hemodynamics and resuscitation, ventilation, endocrine and metabolic therapies, adjunctive therapies, and research priorities. We conducted a systematic review for each Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes question to identify the best available evidence, statistically summarized the evidence, and then assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. We used the evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or as a best practice statement. In addition, â\\x80\\x9cin our practiceâ\\x80\\x9d statements were included when evidence was inconclusive to issue a recommendation, but the panel felt that some guidance based on practice patterns may be appropriate. RESULTS: The panel provided 77 statements on the management and resuscitation of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. Overall, six were strong recommendations, 49 were weak recommendations, and nine were best-practice statements. For 13 questions, no recommendations could be made; but, for 10 of these, â\\x80\\x9cin our practiceâ\\x80\\x9d statements were provided. In addition, 52 research priorities were identified. CONCLUSIONS: A large cohort of international experts was able to achieve consensus regarding many recommendations for the best care of children with sepsis, acknowledging that most aspects of care had relatively low quality of evidence resulting in the frequent issuance of weak recommendations. Despite this challenge, these recommendations regarding the management of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction provide a foundation for consistent care to improve outcomes and inform future research.',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: Influenza virus infections cause a high disease and economic burden during seasonal epidemics. However, there is still a need for reliable disease burden estimates to provide a more detailed picture of the impact of influenza. Therefore, the objectives of this study is to estimate the incidence of hospitalisation for influenza virus infection and associated hospitalisation costs in adult patients in the Netherlands during two consecutive influenza seasons. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in adult patients with a laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection in three Dutch hospitals during respiratory seasons 2014â\\x80\\x932015 and 2015â\\x80\\x932016. Incidence was calculated as the weekly number of hospitalised influenza patients divided by the total population in the catchment populations of the three hospitals. Arithmetic mean hospitalisation costs per patient were estimated and included costs for emergency department consultation, diagnostics, general ward and/or intensive care unit admission, isolation, antibiotic and/or antiviral treatment. These hospitalisation costs were extrapolated to national level and expressed in 2017 euros. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 380 hospitalised adult influenza patients. The seasonal cumulative incidence was 3.5 cases per 10,000 persons in respiratory season 2014â\\x80\\x932015, compared to 1.8 cases per 10,000 persons in 2015â\\x80\\x932016. The arithmetic mean hospitalisation cost per influenza patient was â\\x82¬6128 (95% CI â\\x82¬4934â\\x80\\x93â\\x82¬7737) per patient in 2014â\\x80\\x932015 and â\\x82¬8280 (95% CI â\\x82¬6254â\\x80\\x93â\\x82¬10,665) in 2015â\\x80\\x932016, potentially reaching total hospitalisation costs of â\\x82¬28 million in 2014â\\x80\\x932015 and â\\x82¬20 million in 2015â\\x80\\x932016. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza virus infections lead to 1.8â\\x80\\x933.5 hospitalised patients per 10,000 persons, with mean hospitalisation costs of â\\x82¬6100â\\x80\\x93â\\x82¬8300 per adult patient, resulting in 20â\\x80\\x9328 million euros annually in The Netherlands. The highest arithmetic mean hospitalisation costs per patient were found in the 45â\\x80\\x9364 year age group.

       " 'The widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) has converted the prognosis of HIV infection from a rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal disease to a chronic condition with limited impact on life expectancy. Yet, HIV-infected patients remain at high risk for critical illness due to the occurrence of severe opportunistic infections in those with advanced immunosuppression (i.e., inaugural admissions or limited access to cART), a pronounced susceptibility to bacterial sepsis and tuberculosis at every stage of HIV infection, and a rising prevalence of underlying comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, atherosclerosis or non-AIDS-defining neoplasms in cART-treated patients aging with controlled viral replication. Several patterns of intensive care have markedly evolved in this patient population over the late cART era, including a steady decline in AIDS-related admissions, an opposite trend in admissions for exacerbated comorbidities, the emergence of additional drivers of immunosuppression (e.g., anti-neoplastic chemotherapy or solid organ transplantation), the management of cART in the acute phase of critical illness, and a dramatic progress in short-term survival that mainly results from general advances in intensive care practices. Besides, there is a lack of data regarding other features of ICU and post-ICU care in these patients, especially on the impact of sociological factors on clinical presentation and prognosis, the optimal timing of cART introduction in AIDS-related admissions, determinants of end-of-life decisions, long-term survival, and functional outcomes.

       " 'Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the most frequent ICU-acquired infections. Reported incidences vary widely from 5 to 40% depending on the setting and diagnostic criteria. VAP is associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. The estimated attributable mortality of VAP is around 10%, with higher mortality rates in surgical ICU patients and in patients with mid-range severity scores at admission. Microbiological confirmation of infection is strongly encouraged. Which sampling method to use is still a matter of controversy. Emerging microbiological tools will likely modify our routine approach to diagnosing and treating VAP in the next future. Prevention of VAP is based on minimizing the exposure to mechanical ventilation and encouraging early liberation. Bundles that combine multiple prevention strategies may improve outcomes, but large randomized trials are needed to confirm this. Treatment should be limited to 7 days in the vast majority of the cases. Patients should be reassessed daily to confirm ongoing suspicion of disease, antibiotics should be narrowed as soon as antibiotic susceptibility results are available, and clinicians should consider stopping antibiotics if cultures are negative.',\n",

Secondary outcomes were 30-/90-day mortality, length of hospital stay, and readmission rates. The study included 201 influenza A and 325 influenza B. For the primary composite outcome, no significant difference was demonstrated between influenza A and B. Rates of mortality were similar at 30 and 90 days. Influenza A had higher pneumonia rates and mechanical ventilation. On multivariate analysis, higher Charlsonâ\\x80\\x99s score, hypoalbuminemia, and vasopressor use were associated with 30-day mortality, while infection with either influenza A or B was not.

       " 'Damage to the integrity of heparin sulfate (HS) in the endothelial glycocalyx is an important factor of glomerular filtration barrier dysfunction, which is the basic pathological feature of acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is a common clinical critical illness with few drugs options offering effective treatment. Phillyrin (Phil), the main pharmacological component of Forsythia suspensa, possesses a wide range of pharmacological activities. However, the effects of Phil on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AKI have yet to be reported. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effects of Phil on HS damage and inflammatory signaling pathways in LPS-induced AKI. Results revealed that Phil reduces pathological changes and improves renal function in LPS-induced AKI. Further analysis indicated that Phil effectively protects against glycocalyx HS degradation in LPS-stimulated EA.hy926 cells in vitro and LPS-induced AKI mice in vivo. The protective effect of Phil on HS damage may be associated with the isolateâ\\x80\\x99s ability to suppress the production of reactive oxygen species, and decrease expression levels of cathepsin L and heparanase in vitro and in vivo. In addition, ELISA and Western blot results revealed that Phil inhibits the activation of the NF-ÎºB and MAPK signaling pathways and decreases the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Î², IL-6, and TNF-Î±) in LPS-induced ARDS mice. In general, protection against endothelial glycocalyx HS damage and inhibition of inflammatory responses by Phil may be used as treatment targets for LPS-induced AKI.',\n",
       " 'Acute lung injury (ALI)-triggered pulmonary injury has been associated with high mortality, despite advances in drug treatment and supportive therapy. Remarkable progress has been made in attenuating the inflammatory injury associated with ALI using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based cell and gene therapy. However, to date, the benefits of interleukin-35 (IL-35)-modified MSCs in ALI intervention have not been investigated. In the present study, adult male C57BL/6 mice randomly received intravenous infusion of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) constitutively expressing IL-35 (IL-35-GFP-ADSCs) or GFP (GFP-ADSCs) via retrovirus-mediated transduction (8 Ã\\x97 10(5) cells per mice) or isotonic saline 7 days before ALI modeling to investigate the effect and related mechanism. ALI was performed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) inhalation for 24 h. Normal mice served as the sham group. The results indicated that compared with GFP-ADSCs, IL-35-modified ADSCs significantly increased cellular and pulmonary IL-10 and IL-35 production. Pretreatment with IL-35-ADSCs markedly reduced body weight loss, pulmonary wet/dry weight ratio and pathological injury. The PO(2) was rescued to normal levels in mice that received IL-35-ADSCs. IL-35-ADSCs infusion apparently inhibited IL-6 release, protein leakage and MPO activity but greatly elevated IL-35 level in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Splenic regulatory T cells in IL-35-ADSCs-pretreated mice got effective increase. Moreover, IL-35-ADSCs pretreatment remarkably inhibited neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and greatly decreased IL-6, tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression. In conclusion, pretreatment with IL-35-engineered ADSCs provided effective protection against LPS-induced ALI through suppression of pulmonary inflammation and, thus, might be a promising strategy to improve outcomes after ALI. The enhanced paracrine and immunosuppressive capacity of IL-35-ADSCs might contribute to their beneficial effects. However, further studies are needed to illuminate the detailed mechanism.',\n",

       " 'Effectively responding to global health emergencies requires substantial financial commitment from many stakeholders, including governments, multilateral agencies, and nongovernmental organizations. A major current policy challenge needs attention: how to better coordinate investment among actors aiming to address a common problem, disease outbreaks. For donors who commit colossal sums of money to outbreak response, the current model is neither efficient nor transparent. Innovative approaches to coordinate financing have recently been tested as part of a broader development agenda for humanitarian response. Adopting a system that enables donors to invest in disease outbreaks rather than actors represents an opportunity to deliver a more cost-effective, transparent, and unified global response to infectious disease outbreaks. Achieving this will be challenging, but the World Health Organization (WHO) must play a vital role. New thinking is required to improve emergency response in an increasingly crowded and financially convoluted global health arena.',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanisms of crocin against glycocalyx damage and inflammatory injury in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) mice and LPS-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). METHODS: Mice were randomly divided into control, LPS, and crocin + LPS (15, 30, and 60 mg/kg) groups. HUVECs were separated into eight groups: control, crocin, matrix metalloproteinase 9 inhibitor (MMP-9 inhib), cathepsin L inhibitor (CTL inhib), LPS, MMP-9 inhib + LPS, CTL inhib + LPS, and crocin + LPS. The potential cytotoxic effect of crocin on HUVECs was mainly evaluated through methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. Histological changes were assessed via hemotoxylin and eosin staining. Lung capillary permeability was detected on the basis of wetâ\\x80\\x93dry ratio and through fluorescein isothiocyanate-albumin assay. Then, protein levels were detected through Western blot analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: This study showed that crocin can improve the pulmonary vascular permeability in mice with LPS-induced ARDS and inhibit the inflammatory signaling pathways of high mobility group box, nuclear factor ÎºB, and mitogen-activated protein kinase in vivo and in vitro. Crocin also protected against the degradation of endothelial glycocalyx heparan sulfate and syndecan-4 by inhibiting the expressions of CTL, heparanase, and MMP-9 in vivo and in vitro. Overall, this study revealed the protective effects of crocin on LPS-induced ARDS and elaborated their underlying mechanism. CONCLUSION: Crocin alleviated LPS-induced ARDS by protecting against glycocalyx damage and suppressing inflammatory signaling pathways.',\n",

       " 'INTRODUCTION: Acetabular cup placement is an important modifiable factor determining complication rates like aseptic loosening and hip dislocation related to faulty cup placement, which by standard method is largely dependent upon eyeballing and surgeonâ\\x80\\x99s judgment. We evaluated a self-designed, low-cost, patient-specific acetabular jig to guide cup placement in total hip arthroplasty in comparison to conventional technique. METHODS: It was a prospective randomized control study. Thirty-six patients were categorized into group-A & group-B. In group-A, virtually designed acetabular jig was 3 Dimensional (3D) printed and used intra-operatively to guide cup placement. In group-B, the standard method of cup placement was used. Acetabular cup placement was evaluated on post-operative x-rays and compared between two groups. RESULTS: In group-A, angle of anteversion were significantly in centre of range of safe zone as compared to group B in which hip is maximally stable with more precision in creating hip centre as compared to group-B without any significant(p = 0.325) increase in surgical time or blood loss. CONCLUSION: Computed tomography (CT) scan based virtual pre-operative templating and cup placement guided by virtually designed, patient-specific acetabular jig is a low-cost tool with a short learning curve which can be designed and made available easily. It is a useful tool in decreasing chances of malpositioning of cup and recreates hip centre close to anatomical one especially in cases where anatomy has been distorted such as bony ankylosis and developmental dysplasia of hip.',\n",
       " 'The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) after chemoprophylaxis in patients with pelvic and lower-extremity fractures, and to identify risk factors for VTEs in this subgroup of patients. To detect VTE, multi-detector computed tomography (CT) angiography was performed. Of 363 patients assessed, the incidence of symptomatic VTE was 12.4% (45 patients), and the incidence of symptomatic PE was 5.2% (19 patients). For the risk-factor analysis, a higher Charlson comorbidity index (p = 0.037), and a history of external fixator application (p = 0.007) were associated with increased VTE risk. Among patients who had VTE, male sex (p = 0.017), and above-the-knee fractures (p = 0.035) were associated with increased pulmonary embolism (PE) risk. In conclusions, the incidence of VTE in post-traumatic patients is not low after chemoprophylaxis. Risk factors for VTE and PE are different among patients with pelvic and lower-extremity fractures.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The strong ion model (SIM) is an alternative paradigm in the characterization of acidâ\\x80\\x90base disturbances particularly in complex disorders. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To compare the acidâ\\x80\\x90base changes in dogs with parvoviral enteritis (PE) using the Hendersonâ\\x80\\x90Hasselbalch (HH) approach, with 2 strong ion approaches. ANIMALS: Fortyâ\\x80\\x90four dogs with PE, and 16 ageâ\\x80\\x90matched control dogs. METHODS: Prospective controlled observational study. Acidâ\\x80\\x90base status was evaluated using the HH model, Fenclâ\\x80\\x90Stewart (FS) approach and a validated strong ion model (VDM). The acidâ\\x80\\x90base changes according to each model were classified and compared. Statistical correlations between pH, CO(2), and various SIM variables were performed, as well as between the sum of effects (SOE) of the SIM and the individual variables comprising the SOE. RESULTS: The HH model identified acidâ\\x80\\x90base disorders in 31/44 cases of which 16/31 were mixed with metabolic acidosis and concurrent respiratory alkalosis the most common (10/31). Using the FS approach, metabolic changes were present 36/42 cases, with changes in free water (FW), chloride, and unmeasured anions (UA) being the most prevalent. Both FW and UA correlated well with pH; however, UA were most consistently abnormal in severe acidemia. Similarly to the HH, the VDM detected acidâ\\x80\\x90base disturbances in 28/44 cases. Major contributors to the acidâ\\x80\\x90base changes were hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and A(tot) acidosis because of elevated globulins and increased UA. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Acidâ\\x80\\x90base changes are common and complex in dogs with PE, and were easier to understand using a SIM paradigm. Increases in UA have not been documented in PE in dogs.',\n",
       " 'Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis showing complex epidemiological patterns that are poorly understood in South Africa. Large outbreaks occur in the central interior at long, irregular intervals, most recently in 2010â\\x80\\x932011; however, the level of herd immunity of ruminant livestock, a key determinant of outbreaks, is unknown. During 2015â\\x80\\x932016 a cross-sectional study on 234 randomly-selected farms investigated the prevalence, patterns of, and factors associated with, antibodies to RVF virus (RVFV) in livestock in an area heavily affected by that outbreak. A RVFV inhibition ELISA was used to screen 977 cattle, 1,549 sheep and 523 goats and information on potential risk factors was collected using a comprehensive questionnaire. The estimated RVFV seroprevalence, adjusted for survey design, was 42.9% in cattle, 28.0% in sheep and 9.3% in goats, showing a high degree of farm-level clustering. Seroprevalence increased with age and was higher on private vs. communal land, on farms with seasonal pans (temporary, shallow wetlands) and perennial rivers and in recently vaccinated animals. Seropositivity amongst unvaccinated animals born after the last outbreak indicates likely viral circulation during the post-epidemic period. The current level of herd immunity in livestock may be insufficient to prevent another large outbreak, should suitable conditions recur.',\n",
       " 'The aim of the present study was to investigate whether TIPE2 participates in the protective actions of dexmedetomidine (DEX) in a mouse model of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). We administered TIPE2 adeno-associated virus (AAV-TIPE2) intratracheally into the lungs of mice. Control mice were infected with an adeno-associated virus expressing no transgene. Three weeks later, an animal model of caecal ligation-perforation (CLP)-induced sepsis was established. DEX was administered intravenously 30 min after CLP. Twenty-four hours after sepsis, lung injury was assayed by lung histology, the ratio of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to total cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, BALF protein content and the lung wet-to-dry (W/D) weight ratio. Proinflammatory factor levels in the BALF of mice were measured. The protein expression levels in lung tissues were analysed by Western blotting. The results showed that DEX treatment markedly mitigated sepsis-induced lung injury, which was characterized by the deterioration of histopathology, histologic scores, the W/D weight ratio and total protein levels in the BALF. Moreover, DEX markedly attenuated sepsis-induced lung inflammation, as evidenced by the decrease in the number of PMNs in the BALF, lung MPO activity and proinflammatory cytokines in the BALF. In addition, DEX dramatically prevented sepsis-induced pulmonary cell apoptosis in mice, as reflected by decreases in the number of TUNEL-positive cells, the protein expression of cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase 3 and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In addition, evaluation of protein expression showed that DEX blocked sepsis-activated JNK phosphorylation and NF-ÎºB p65 nuclear translocation. Similar results were also observed in the TIPE2 overexpression group. Our study demonstrated that DEX inhibits acute inflammation and apoptosis in a murine model of sepsis-stimulated ALI via the upregulation of TIPE2 and the suppression of the activation of the NF-ÎºB and JNK signalling pathways.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Understanding factors driving virological failure, including the contribution of HIV drug resistance mutations (DRM), is critical to ensuring HIV treatment remains effective. We examine the contribution of drug resistance mutations for low viral suppression in HIV-positive participants in a population-based sero-prevalence survey in rural South Africa. METHODS: We conducted HIV drug resistance genotyping and ART analyte testing on dried blood spots (DBS) from HIV-positive adults participating in a 2014 survey in North West Province. Among those with virologic failure (> 5000 copies/mL), we describe frequency of DRM to protease inhibitors (PI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), report association of resistance with antiretroviral therapy (ART) status, and assess resistance to first and second line therapy. Analyses are weighted to account for sampling design. RESULTS: Overall 170 DBS samples were assayed for viral load and ART analytes; 78.4% of men and 50.0% of women had evidence of virologic failure and were assessed for drug resistance, with successful sequencing of 76/107 samples. We found â\\x89¥1 DRM in 22% of participants; 47% were from samples with detectable analyte (efavirenz, nevirapine or lopinavir). Of those with DRM and detectable analyte, 60% showed highâ\\x80\\x93level resistance and reduced predicted virologic response to â\\x89¥1 NRTI/NNRTI typically used in first and second-line regimens. CONCLUSIONS: DRM and predicted reduced susceptibility to first and second-line regimens were common among adults with ART exposure in a rural South African population-based sample. Results underscore the importance of ongoing virologic monitoring, regimen optimization and adherence counseling to optimize durable virologic suppression.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Treatment of resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection continues to be a challenge in Latin American countries (LATAM). We synthesize the literature on the use of appropriate initial antibiotic therapy (AIAT) and inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy (IIAT) in P. aeruginosa infections, and the literature on risk factors for acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa among hospitalized adult patients in LATAM. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and LILAC were searched between 2000 and August 2019. Abstracts and full-text articles were screened in duplicate. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted when studies were sufficiently similar. RESULTS: The screening of 165 citations identified through literature search yielded 98 full-text articles that were retrieved and assessed for eligibility, and 19 articles conducted in Brazil (14 articles), Colombia (4 articles), and Cuba (1 article) met the inclusion criteria. Of 19 eligible articles, six articles (840 subjects) examined AIAT compared to IIAT in P. aeruginosa infections; 17 articles (3203 total subjects) examined risk factors for acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa; and four articles evaluated both. Four of 19 articles were rated low risk of bias and the remaining were deemed unclear or high risk of bias. In meta-analysis, AIAT was associated with lower mortality for P. aeruginosa infections (unadjusted summary OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28â\\x80\\x930.81; I(2) = 59%), compared to IIAT and the association with mortality persisted in subgroup meta-analysis by low risk of bias (3 articles; unadjusted summary OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28â\\x80\\x930.81; I(2) = 0%). No meta-analysis was performed for studies evaluating risk factors for acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa as they were not sufficiently similar. Significant risk factors for acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa included: prior use of antibiotics (11 articles), stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) (3 articles), and comorbidity score (3 articles). Outcomes were graded to be of low strength of evidence owing to unclear or high risk of bias and imprecise estimates. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the association of AIAT with lower mortality and prior use of antibiotics significantly predicts acquiring resistant P. aeruginosa infections. This review reinforces the need for rigorous and structured antimicrobial stewardship programs in the LATAM region.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Malignant tumors are risk factors for a pulmonary embolism (PE), and a PE caused by a tumor is not uncommon. Primary pleural squamous cell carcinoma (PPSCC) is a rare malignancy; thus, a related PE is extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 49-year-old female patient was admitted to Northern Jiangsu Peopleâ\\x80\\x99s Hospital owing to chest tightness, cough, and breathing difficulty that persisted for 3 days. Following admission, a computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography revealed an embolism in the main pulmonary artery, upper and lower pulmonary artery branch. The patient was treated with alteplase, warfarin, and antibiotics. Over the following year, she experienced recurrent chest pain and tightness and breathing difficulty, with multiple CT pulmonary angiography revealing thrombosis in the right and left main pulmonary artery. No abnormalities were observed in surrogate markers of autoimmune diseases, tumor antigen testing, or ultrasonography; thus, the cause of recurrent PE was not identified. Subsequently, a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) examination revealed diffuse heterogeneous thickening of the right pleura and substantially increased glucose metabolism. A CT-guided pleural biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of the pleura eventually revealed a diagnosis of PPSCC. CONCLUSIONS: PPSCC is a rare tumor that lacks specific clinical manifestations and is difficult to detect with imaging techniques. The occurrence of PE as the primary manifesting symptom in a patient with PPSCC is extremely rare. Thus, malignant tumors should be considered in patients with no risk factors for PE and/or in those with recurrent PE. An immediate diagnosis and adequate intervention can be achieved with increased awareness of this diagnosis and subsequent related examinations.',\n",

We show that the virus-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is smaller than one, and by regarding the time delay as a bifurcation parameter, the existence of local Hopf bifurcation is investigated. The results show that time delay can change the stability of the endemic equilibrium. Finally, we give some numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical findings.',\n",

       " 'The forced convection (air supply jet) and the natural convection (thermal plume of passenger) co-exist in an aircraft cabin simultaneously. Due to the notable difference of the Reynolds numbers for the two convection processes, the traditional RANS method can hardly simulate the forced/natural convection flows accurately at the same time. In addition, the large geometric ratio between the main air supply inlet and the whole cabin leads to difficulties in grid generation for the cabin space. An efficient computational model based on the standard k-e model is established to solve these problems. The coefficients in the dissipative equation are modified to compensate the enlarged numerical dissipation caused by coarse grid; meanwhile, the piecewise-defined turbulent viscosity is introduced to combine the forced and natural convection. The modified model is validated by available experimental results in a Boeing 737-200 mock-up. Furthermore, the unsteady characteristic of the aircraft cabin environment is obtained and analyzed. According to the frequency analysis, it turns out that the thermal plume is the main factor of the unsteady fluctuation in cabin.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Public health surveillance is based on the continuous and systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. This informs the development of early warning systems to monitor epidemics and documents the impact of intervention measures. The introduction of digital data sources, and specifically sources available on the internet, has impacted the field of public health surveillance. New opportunities enabled by the underlying availability and scale of internet-based sources (IBSs) have paved the way for novel approaches for disease surveillance, exploration of health communities, and the study of epidemic dynamics. This field and approach is also known as infodemiology or infoveillance. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to assess research findings regarding the application of IBSs for public health surveillance (infodemiology or infoveillance). To achieve this, we have presented a comprehensive systematic literature review with a focus on these sources and their limitations, the diseases targeted, and commonly applied methods. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted targeting publications between 2012 and 2018 that leveraged IBSs for public health surveillance, outbreak forecasting, disease characterization, diagnosis prediction, content analysis, and health-topic identification. The search results were filtered according to previously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Spanning a total of 162 publications, we determined infectious diseases to be the preferred case study (108/162, 66.7%). Of the eight categories of IBSs (search queries, social media, news, discussion forums, websites, web encyclopedia, and online obituaries), search queries and social media were applied in 95.1% (154/162) of the reviewed publications. We also identified limitations in representativeness and biased user age groups, as well as high susceptibility to media events by search queries, social media, and web encyclopedias. CONCLUSIONS: IBSs are a valuable proxy to study illnesses affecting the general population; however, it is important to characterize which diseases are best suited for the available sources; the literature shows that the level of engagement among online platforms can be a potential indicator. There is a necessity to understand the populationâ\\x80\\x99s online behavior; in addition, the exploration of health information dissemination and its content is significantly unexplored. With this information, we can understand how the population communicates about illnesses online and, in the process, benefit public health.',\n",

       " 'In past decades, interdisciplinary research has been of great interest for scholars. Thiazolidine motifs behave as a bridge between organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry and compel researchers to explore new drug candidates. Thiazolidine motifs are very intriguing heterocyclic five-membered moieties present in diverse natural and bioactive compounds having sulfur at the first position and nitrogen at the third position. The presence of sulfur enhances their pharmacological properties, and, therefore, they are used as vehicles in the synthesis of valuable organic combinations. They show varied biological properties viz. anticancer, anticonvulsant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antioxidant activity and so on. This diversity in the biological response makes it a highly prized moiety. Based on literature studies, various synthetic approaches like multicomponent reaction, click reaction, nano-catalysis and green chemistry have been employed to improve their selectivity, purity, product yield and pharmacokinetic activity. In this review article, we have summarized systematic approaches for the synthesis of thiazolidine and its derivatives, along with their pharmacological activity, including advantages of green synthesis, atom economy, cleaner reaction profile and catalyst recovery which will help scientists to probe and stimulate the study of these scaffolds.',\n",

In the CARTO procedure, coil embolization of the drainage vein is performed â\\x80\\x9cbeforeâ\\x80\\x9d injection of the sclerosant to replace the use of balloon catheter. In the CARTO-II procedure, coil embolization of the drainage vein was performed â\\x80\\x9cafterâ\\x80\\x9d injection of the sclerosant to prevent migration of the sclerosant. CARTO-II was performed with ethanolamine oleate iopamidol, and the balloon catheter was immediately removed after coil placement. Technical and clinical success rates, number of coils used, presence or absence of severe complications, timing of the procedure, and rate of GV recurrence after the procedure were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: In all patients, GV sclerosis, coil placement and removal of the balloon catheter were successfully completed. The technical success rate was 100%. No patients experienced severe complications such as coil migration or pulmonary embolization. The mean number of metallic coils used per procedure was 3.36. Mean length of the procedure was 132.8 min. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography after CARTO-II confirmed complete variceal thrombosis in all cases. The recurrence rate of GV during follow-up was 2.8% (mean follow-up, 207 days). CONCLUSION: CARTO-II was feasible and safe and could be performed relatively quickly. The number of coils used and the rate of GV recurrence were both low. CARTO-II may have an important role to play in the management of GV.',\n",

       " 'PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: The main goal of this article is to discuss how the development of state-of-the-art technology has made it possible to address fundamental questions related to how the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) operates within the brain from the neurophysiological and molecular perspective. RECENT FINDINGS: The existence of the brain RAS remains surprisingly controversial. New sensitive in situ hybridization techniques and novel transgenic animals expressing reporter genes have provided pivotal information of the expression of RAS genes within the brain. We discuss studies using genetically engineered animals combined with targeted viral microinjections to study molecular mechanisms implicated in the regulation of the brain RAS. We also discuss novel drugs targeting the brain RAS that have shown promising results in clinical studies and trials. SUMMARY: Over the last 50 years, several new physiological roles of the brain RAS have been identified. In the coming years, efforts to incorporate cutting-edge technologies such as optogenetics, chemogenetics, and single-cell RNA sequencing will lead to dramatic advances in our full understanding of how the brain RAS operates at molecular and neurophysiological levels.',\n",
       " 'With increased use of medical imaging, the incidental detection of benign solid liver tumors has become more frequent. Facing with benign disease, the indications for surgery are still object of discussion in light of the stable natural course of most lesions and obvious drawbacks of any surgical intervention; therefore, in most situations, a conservative approach is recommended, and surgery is mainly reserved for those cases with persistent or worsening symptoms, or who are at risk for complications as malignant transformation. The advent of ablative techniques has widened the range of treatment options available to these patients, presenting as a valid alternative to resection in terms of safety and efficacy in selected cases, particularly in patients who are considered poor surgical candidates and with smaller lesions. This review outlines the role of percutaneous ablative methods for benign solid liver tumors that are encountered in adults, providing a per histology analysis of the existing evidence. The up-to-date strategies for management of the most common benign solid tumors are recapitulated.',\n",

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of advances in spinal surgery on patient outcomes in the treatment of Scheuermann kyphosis (SK). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: SK is one of the most common causes of back pain in adolescents. Trends in diagnoses and surgical treatment and approach to SK have not been well described. METHODS: SK patients aged 0â\\x80\\x9320 years in KID were identified by ICD-9 code 732.0. KID-supplied year- and hospital-trend weights were used to establish prevalence. Patient demographics, surgical details, and outcomes were analyzed with analysis of variance. RESULTS: A total of 1,070 SK patients were identified (33.2% female), with increasing incidence of SK diagnosed from 2003 to 2012 (3.6â\\x80\\x937.5 per 100,000, p < .001). The average age of operative patients was 16.1Â±2.0 years and did not change (16.27â\\x80\\x9316.06 years, p = .905). The surgical rate has not changed over time (72.8%â\\x80\\x9372.8%, p = .909). Overall, 96.3% of operative patients underwent fusion, with 82.2% of cases spanning â©¾4 levels; in addition, 8.6% underwent an anterior-only surgery, 74.6% posterior-only, and 13.6% combined approach. From 2003 to 2012, rates of posterior-only surgeries increased (62.4%â\\x80\\x9384.4%, p < .001) whereas the rate of combined-approach surgeries decreased (37.6%â\\x80\\x938.8%, p < .001). Overall complication rates for SK surgeries have decreased (2003: 20.9%; 2012: 11.9%, p = .029). Concurrently, the rate of â©¾4-level fusions has increased (43.5%â\\x80\\x9389.6%, p < .001), as well as the use of Smith-Peterson (7.8%â\\x80\\x9323.6%, p < .001) and three-column osteotomies (0.0%â\\x80\\x932.7%, p = .011). In subanalysis comparing posterior to combined approaches, complication rates were significantly different (posterior: 9.88%, combined: 19.46%, p = .005). Patients undergoing a combined approach have a longer length of stay (LOS) than patients undergoing a posterior-only approach (7.8 vs. 5.6 days, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite unchanged demographics and operative rates in SK, there has been a shift from combined to isolated posterior approaches, with a concurrent increase in levels treated. A combined approach was associated with increased complication rates, LOS, and total charges compared to isolated approaches. Awareness of these inherent differences is important for surgical decision making and patient education. LEVELS OF EVIDENCE: Level III.',\n",

We have used placenta-derived decidua stromal cells (DSCs) to treat graft-versus-host disease and found an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effect. We here report the use of DSCs in two patients with radiculomyelopathy. The first patient was a 73-year old man treated with parotidectomy and irradiation for lymphoma of the neck. Following a Yersinia infection, he developed a radiculomyelopathy in C3/C4 and could not elevate his arms. The second patient was a 34-year old woman who was admitted 8 months after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation due to hemolysis, impaired sensorium below arcus, and difficulty in ambulation. Following intravenous infusion of DSCs (1 Ã\\x97 10(6)/kg/infusion), the first patient could elevate his arms to the facial level. He experienced recurrent paralysis after 6 months, and the efficacy of four additional DSC infusions, at subsequent occasions, were limited and transient. The second patient was treated with two doses of DSCs (1 Ã\\x97 10(6)/kg/infusion). After cell infusion, she was able to stand on one leg, sensation in the belly normalized, and she was discharged.

       " 'The purpose of this study was to assess the value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) for the diagnosis of severe respiratory diseases based on interpretation of sequencing results. BALF samples were harvested and used for mNGS as well as microbiological detection. Infectious bacteria or fungi were defined according to relative abundance and number of unique reads. We performed mNGS on 35 BALF samples from 32 patients. The positive rate reached 100% in the mNGS analysis of nine immunocompromised patients. Compared with the culture method, mNGS had a diagnostic sensitivity of 88.89% and a specificity of 74.07% with an agreement rate of 77.78% between these two methods. Compared with the smear method and PCR, mNGS had a diagnostic sensitivity of 77.78% and a specificity of 70.00%. In 13 cases, detection results were positive by mNGS but negative by culture/smear and PCR. The mNGS findings in 11/32 (34.4%) cases led to changes in treatment strategies. Linear regression analysis showed that diversity was significantly correlated with interval between disease onset and sampling. Dynamic changes in reads could indirectly reflect therapeutic effectiveness. BALF mNGS improves sensitivity of pathogen detection and provides guidance in clinical practice. Potential pathogens can be identified based on relative abundance and number of unique reads.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Patients with oncologic diseases, particularly those with hematologic malignancies, are at an increased risk of common infections and unique treatment-related complications with high mortality and morbidity. The annual incidence and prevalence of cancer in Germany is rising. Although modern treatments have generally led to improved survival, increasing age, comorbidities, and frailty of the patients require multidisciplinary strategies for handling complex therapeutic concepts and treatment of the associated complications. METHODS: A selective literature search and guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology (Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r HÃ¤matologie und Medizinische Onkologie, DGHO), the Infectious Diseases Working Group of the DGHO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Infektionen in der HÃ¤matologie und Onkologie, AGIHO), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) formed the basis of this study. CONCLUSION: Recognition of severe infections in cancer patients and their discrimination from treatment-associated complications is a challenge. Neutropenic fever is the most frequent infectious emergency in oncology. Early empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and escalated diagnostic strategies are needed to successfully treat this vulnerable patient group. In this article, a range of potentially life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients are discussed.',\n",

       " 'Respiratory muscle ultrasound is used to evaluate the anatomy and function of the respiratory muscle pump. It is a safe, repeatable, accurate, and non-invasive bedside technique that can be successfully applied in different settings, including general intensive care and the emergency department. Mastery of this technique allows the intensivist to rapidly diagnose and assess respiratory muscle dysfunction in critically ill patients and in patients with unexplained dyspnea. Furthermore, it can be used to assess patientâ\\x80\\x93ventilator interaction and weaning failure in critically ill patients. This paper provides an overview of the basic and advanced principles underlying respiratory muscle ultrasound with an emphasis on the diaphragm. We review different ultrasound techniques useful for monitoring of the respiratory muscle pump and possible therapeutic consequences. Ideally, respiratory muscle ultrasound is used in conjunction with other components of critical care ultrasound to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of the critically ill patient. We propose the ABCDE-ultrasound approach, a systematic ultrasound evaluation of the heart, lungs and respiratory muscle pump, in patients with weaning failure.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Multi-organ dysfunction in critical illness is common and frequently involves the lungs and kidneys, often requiring organ support such as invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), renal replacement therapy (RRT) and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). METHODS: A consensus conference on the spectrum of lungâ\\x80\\x93kidney interactions in critical illness was held under the auspices of the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) in Innsbruck, Austria, in June 2018. Through review and critical appraisal of the available evidence, the current state of research, and both clinical and research recommendations were described on the following topics: epidemiology, pathophysiology and strategies to mitigate pulmonary dysfunction among patients with acute kidney injury and/or kidney dysfunction among patients with acute respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, emphasis was put on patients receiving organ support (RRT, IMV and/or ECMO) and its impact on lung and kidney function. CONCLUSION: The ADQI 21 conference found significant knowledge gaps about organ crosstalk between lung and kidney and its relevance for critically ill patients. Lung protective ventilation, conservative fluid management and early recognition and treatment of pulmonary infections were the only clinical recommendations with higher quality of evidence. Recommendations for research were formulated, targeting lungâ\\x80\\x93kidney interactions to improve care processes and outcomes in critical illness.

There has recently been renewed interest in physiological closed-loop control of ventilation. The development of these systems has followed a similar path to that of manual clinical ventilation, starting with ensuring optimal gas exchange and shifting to the prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury. Systems currently aim to encompass both aspects, and early commercial systems are appearing. These developments remain unknown to many clinicians and, hence, limit their adoption into the clinical environment.

       " 'Biomedical applications increasingly require fully characterized new nanomaterials. There is strong evidence showing that nanomaterials not only interact with cells passively but also actively, mediating essential molecular processes for the regulation of cellular functions, but we are only starting to understand the mechanisms of those interactions. Systematic studies about cell behavior as a response to specific nanoparticle properties are scarce in the literature even when they are necessary for the rational design of medical nanodevices. Information in the literature shows that the physicochemical properties determine the bioactivity, biocompatibility, and safety of nanomaterials. The information available regarding the interaction and responses of cells to nanomaterials has not been analyzed and discussed in a single document. Hence, in this review, we present the latest advances about cellular responses to nanomaterials and integrate the available information into concrete considerations for the development of innovative, efficient, specific and, more importantly, safe biomedical nanodevices. We focus on how physicochemical nanoparticle properties (size, chemical surface, shape, charge, and topography) influence cell behavior in a first attempt to provide a practical guide for designing medical nanodevices, avoiding common experimental omissions that may lead to data misinterpretation. Finally, we emphasize the importance of the systematic study of nanoâ\\x80\\x93bio interactions to acquire sufficient reproducible information that allows accurate control of cell behavior based on tuning of nanomaterial properties. This information is useful to guide the design of specific nanodevices and nanomaterials to elicit desired cell responses, like targeting, drug delivery, cell attachment, differentiation, etc, or to avoid undesired side effects.',\n",
       " 'When herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection is initiated in the ocular, nasal, or oral cavity, sensory neurons within trigeminal ganglia (TG) become infected. Following a burst of viral transcription in TG neurons, lytic cycle viral genes are suppressed and latency is established. The latency-associated transcript (LAT) is the only viral gene abundantly expressed during latency, and LAT expression is important for the latency-reactivation cycle. Reactivation from latency is required for virus transmission and recurrent disease, including encephalitis. The Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway is differentially expressed in TG during the bovine herpesvirus 1 latency-reactivation cycle. Hence, we hypothesized HSV-1 regulates the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway and promotes maintenance of latency because this pathway enhances neuronal survival and axonal repair. New studies revealed Î²-catenin was expressed in significantly more TG neurons during latency compared to TG from uninfected mice or mice latently infected with a LAT(-/-) mutant virus. When TG explants were incubated with media containing dexamethasone to stimulate reactivation, significantly fewer Î²-catenin+ TG neurons were detected. Conversely, TG explants from uninfected mice or mice latently infected with a LAT(-/-) mutant increased the number of Î²-catenin+ TG neurons in the presence of DEX relative to samples not treated with DEX. Impairing Wnt signaling with small molecule antagonists reduced virus shedding during explant-induced reactivation. These studies suggested Î²-catenin was differentially expressed during the latency-reactivation cycle, in part due to LAT expression.',\n",

Among infectious agents, viruses pose a serious threat to public health and global economy because they are often difficult to detect and their infections are hard to treat. Since it is crucial to develop rapid, accurate, cost-effective, and in-situ methods for early detection viruses, a variety of sensors have been reported so far. This review provides an overview of the recent developments in electrochemical sensors and biosensors for detecting viruses and use of these sensors on environmental, clinical and food monitoring. Electrochemical biosensors for determining viruses are divided into four main groups including nucleic acid-based, antibody-based, aptamer-based and antigen-based electrochemical biosensors. Finally, the drawbacks and advantages of each type of sensors are identified and discussed.',\n",
       " 'PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of the operation for type III esophageal atresia using a thoracoscope. METHODS: The clinical data for 92 patients with type III esophageal atresia in our hospital from January 2015 to December 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. There were 49 patients in group A who underwent thoracoscopic surgery and 43 patients in group B who underwent conventional surgery. RESULTS: The mechanical ventilation time (55.7 Â± 11.4 h vs 75.6 Â± 19.2 h), intensive care time (3.6 Â± 1.8d vs 4.7 Â± 2.0d), postoperative hospitalization time (13.1 Â± 2.2d vs 16.8 Â± 4.3d), thoracic drainage volume (62.7 Â± 25.5 ml vs 125.4 Â± 46.1 ml), blood transfusion volume (30.5 Â± 10.4 ml vs 55.3 Â± 22.7 ml) and surgical incision length (2.0 Â± 0.5 cm vs 8.0 Â± 1.8 cm) in group A were lower than those in group B, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Among the postoperative complications, the incidences of postoperative severe pneumonia (8.2% vs 23.3%), poor wound healing (2.0% vs 14.0%) and chest wall deformity (0% vs 11.6%) in group A were significantly lower than those in group B (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of anastomotic stricture, tracheomalacia or gastroesophageal reflux between the two groups after surgery and early during follow-up (P > 0.05), and there were no complications such as achalasia signs and esophageal diverticulum in either group. CONCLUSION: Surgery for type III esophageal atresia via thoracoscopy has the same safety and clinical effectiveness as traditional surgery and has the advantages of smaller incision and chest wall deformity.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Inflammatory response is activated during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), which may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and procalcitonin (PCT) increases during this inflammatory response. The objective of the study was to validate whether patients with higher serum PCT concentrations have a higher incidence of ARDS. METHODS: The study was a prospective, single-center, observational cohort study. All patients who received cardiac surgery with CPB were screened for study eligibility. Patients were assigned to the PCT-elevated cohort or the control cohort according to serum PCT concentration on the first postoperative day with a cut-off value of 7.0 ng/mL. Patients were followed up until the 7th postoperative day. The primary endpoint was the incidence of ARDS, which was diagnosed according to the Berlin definition. RESULTS: A total of 296 patients were enrolled, 64 patients were assigned to the PCT-elevated cohort and 232 patients were assigned to the control cohort. PCT concentration was 16.23 Â± 5.9 ng/mL in the PCT-elevated cohort, and 2.70 Â± 1.43 ng/mL in the control cohort (p < 0.001). The incidence of ARDS was significantly higher in the PCT-elevated cohort than in the control cohort (21.9% versus 5.6%, p < 0.001). The incidence of moderate-to-severe ARDS was also significantly higher in the PCT-elevated cohort than in the control cohort (10.9% versus 0.4%, p < 0.001). The hazard ratio of ARDS at 7 days in the PCT-elevated cohort, as compared with the control cohort, was 6.8 (95% confidence interval 2.7 to 17.4). The hazard ratio of moderate-to-severe ARDS in the PCT-elevated cohort was 57.3 (95% confidence interval 10.4 to 316.3). The positive predictive value of PCT for ARDS and moderate-to-severe ARDS were 0.242 and 0.121, respectively; the negative predictive value of PCT for ARDS and moderate-to-severe ARDS were 0.952 and 1.0, respectively. CONCLUSION: Cardiac surgical patients with elevated PCT concentration have a higher incidence of ARDS. Elevated PCT may serve as a warning signal of postoperative ARDS in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Study registration Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-OCH-14005076)',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Owing to the large amount of host DNA in clinical samples, generation of high-quality Plasmodium falciparum whole genome sequencing (WGS) data requires enrichment for parasite DNA. Enrichment is often achieved by leukocyte depletion of infected blood prior to storage. However, leukocyte depletion is difficult in low-resource settings and limits analysis to prospectively-collected samples. As a result, approaches such as selective whole genome amplification (sWGA) are being used to enrich for parasite DNA. However, sWGA has had limited success in generating reliable sequencing data from low parasitaemia samples. In this study, enzymatic digestion with MspJI prior to sWGA and whole genome sequencing was evaluated to determine whether this approach improved genome coverage compared to sWGA alone. The potential of sWGA to cause amplification bias in polyclonal infections was also examined. METHODS: DNA extracted from laboratory-created dried blood spots was treated with a modification-dependent restriction endonuclease, MspJI, and filtered via vacuum filtration. Samples were then selectively amplified using a previously reported sWGA protocol and subjected to WGS. Genome coverage statistics were compared between the optimized sWGA approach and the previously reported sWGA approach performed in parallel. Differential amplification by sWGA was assessed by comparing WGS data generated from lab-created mixtures of parasite isolates, from the same geographical region, generated with or without sWGA. RESULTS: MspJI digestion did not enrich for parasite DNA. Samples that underwent vacuum filtration (without MspJI digestion) prior to sWGA had the highest parasite DNA concentration and displayed greater genome coverage compared to MspJI + sWGA and sWGA alone, particularly for low parasitaemia samples. The optimized sWGA (filtration + sWGA) approach was successfully used to generate WGS data from 218 non-leukocyte depleted field samples from Malawi. Sequences from lab-created mixtures of parasites did not show evidence of differential amplification of parasite strains compared to directly sequenced samples. CONCLUSION: This optimized sWGA approach is a reliable method to obtain WGS data from non-leukocyte depleted, low parasitaemia samples. The absence of amplification bias in data generated from mixtures of isolates from the same geographic region suggests that this approach can be appropriately used for molecular epidemiological studies.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The probability of weaning and of long-term survival of chronically mechanically ventilated cancer patients is unknown, with incomplete information available to guide therapeutic decisions. We sought to determine the probability of weaning and overall survival of cancer patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation in a specialized weaning unit. METHODS: A single-institution retrospective review of patients requiring mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting from 2008 to 2012 and from January 1 to December 31, 2018, was performed. Demographic and clinical data were recorded, including cancer specifics, comorbidities, treatments, and outcomes. Overall survival was determined using the Kaplan-Meier approach. Time to weaning was analyzed using the cumulative incidence function, with death considered a competing risk. Prognostic factors were evaluated for use in prospective evaluations of weaning protocols. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2012, 122 patients required mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting with weaning as a goal of care. The cumulative incidence of weaning after discharge from the intensive care unit was 42% at 21 days, 49% at 30 days, 58% at 60 days, 61% at 90 days, and 61% at 120 days. The median survival was 0.16 years (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.33) for those not weaned and 1.05 years (95% CI, 0.60 to 1.34) for those weaned. Overall survival at 1 year and 2 years was 52 and 32% among those weaned and 16 and 9% among those not weaned. During 2018, 36 patients at our institution required mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting, with weaning as a goal of care. Overall, with a median follow-up of 140 days (range, 0â\\x80\\x93425 days; average, 141 days), 25% of patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation (9 of 36) are alive. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients can be weaned from long-term mechanical ventilation, even after prolonged periods of support. Implementation of a resource-intensive weaning program did not improve rates of successful weaning. No clear time on mechanical ventilation could be identified beyond which weaning was unprecedented. Short-term overall survival for these patients is poor.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: During the erythrocytic cycle, Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites express P. falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 (PfEMP1) that anchor the infected erythrocytes (IE) to the vascular lining of the host. The CIDRÎ±1 domain of PfEMP1 is responsible for binding host endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), and increasing evidence support that this interaction triggers severe malaria, accounting for the majority of malaria-related deaths. In high transmission regions, children develop immunity to severe malaria after the first few infections. This immunity is believed to be mediated by antibodies targeting and inhibiting PfEMP1, causing infected erythrocytes to circulate and be cleared in the spleen. The development of immunity to malaria coincides with acquisition of broad antibody reactivity across the CIDRÎ±1 protein family. Altogether, this identifies CIDRÎ±1 as an important vaccine target. However, the antigenic diversity of the CIDRÎ±1 domain family is a challenge for vaccine development. METHODS: Immune responses in mice vaccinated with Virus-Like Particles (VLP) presenting CIDRÎ±1 antigens were investigated. Antibody reactivity was tested to a panel of recombinant CIDRÎ±1 domains, and the antibodies ability to inhibit EPCR binding by the recombinant CIDRÎ±1 domains was tested in Luminex-based multiplex assays. RESULTS: VLP-presented CIDRÎ±1.4 antigens induced a rapid and strong IgG response capable of inhibiting EPCR-binding of multiple CIDRÎ±1 domains mainly within the group A CIDRÎ±1.4â\\x80\\x937 subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The study observations mirror those from previous CIDRÎ±1 vaccine studies using other vaccine constructs and platforms. This suggests that broad CIDRÎ±1 antibody reactivity may be achieved through vaccination with a limited number of CIDRÎ±1 variants. In addition, this study suggest that this may be achieved through vaccination with a human compatible VLP vaccine platform.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The calcium-selective channel TRPV6 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 6) is crucial for maternal-fetal calcium transport across the placenta. TRPV6 mutations have recently been associated with an antenatally severe under-mineralising skeletal dysplasia accompanied by postnatal biochemical abnormalities. This is the first post-mortem report in a patient with TRPV6 skeletal dysplasia. CASE PRESENTATION: The female infant had severe antenatal and postnatal skeletal abnormalities by 20 weeks gestation and was ventilator-dependent from birth. These skeletal abnormalities were apparent at an earlier gestational age than in previous reported cases and a more severe clinical course ensued. Biochemical and skeletal abnormalities, including bone density, improved postnatally but cardiac arrest at 4 months of age led to withdrawal of intensive care. Compound heterozygous TRPV6 variants (c.1978G > C p.(Gly660Arg) and c.1528C > T p.(Arg510Ter)) were identified on exome sequencing. Post-mortem identified skeletal abnormalities but no specific abnormalities in other organ systems. No placental pathology was found, multi-organ histological features reflected prolonged intensive care only. Post-mortem macroscopic examination indicated reduced thoracic size and short, pale and pliable ribs. Histological examination identified reduced number of trabeculae in the diaphyses (away from the growth plates), whereas metaphyses showed adequate mineralisation and normal number of trabeculae, but with slightly enlarged reactive chondrocytes, indicating post-natal skeletal growth recovery. Post-mortem radiological findings demonstrated improved bone density, improved rib width, healed fractures, although ribs were still shorter than normal. Long bones (especially humerus and femur) had improved from initial poorly defined metaphyses and reduced bone density to sharply defined metaphyses, prominent growth restart lines in distal diaphyses and bone-in-bone appearance along diaphyses. CONCLUSIONS: This case provide bone histological confirmation that human skeletal development is compromised in the presence of TRPV6 pathogenic variants. Post-mortem findings were consistent with abnormal in utero skeletal mineralisation due to severe calcium deficit from compromised placental calcium transfer, followed by subsequent phenotypic improvement with adequate postnatal calcium availability. Significant skeletal recovery occurs in the early weeks of postnatal life in TRPV6 skeletal dysplasia.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for an effective vaccine to control and eradicate malaria, one of the most serious global infectious diseases. Plasmodium merozoite surface protein 4 (MSP4) has been listed as a blood-stage subunit vaccine candidate for malaria. Infection with Plasmodium ovale species including P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi, is also a source of malaria burden in tropical regions where it is sometimes mixed with other Plasmodium species. However, little is known about P. ovale MSP4. METHODS: The msp4 gene was amplified through polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA extracted from blood samples of 46 patients infected with P. ovale spp. and amplified products were sequenced. Open reading frames predicted as immunogenic peptides consisting of 119 and 97 amino acids of P. ovale curtisi MSP4 (PocMSP4) and P. ovale wallikeri MSP4 (PowMSP4), respectively, were selected for protein expression. Recombinant proteins (rPoMSP4) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, analysed, and immunized in BALB/c mice. The specificity of anti-MSP4-immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies was evaluated by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and cellular immune responses were analysed via lymphocyte proliferation assays. RESULTS: Full peptide sequences of PocMSP4 and PowMSP4 were completely conserved in all clinical isolates, except in the epidermal growth factor-like domain at the carboxyl terminus where only one mutation was observed in one P. o. wallikeri isolate. Further, truncated PoMSP4 segments were successfully expressed and purified as ~ 32 kDa proteins. Importantly, high antibody responses with end-point titres ranging from 1:10,000 to 1:2,560,000 in all immunized mouse groups were observed, with high IgG avidity to PocMSP4 (80.5%) and PowMSP4 (92.3%). Furthermore, rPocMSP4 and rPowMSP4 cross-reacted with anti-PowMSP4-specific or anti-PocMSP4-specific antibodies. Additionally, anti-PoMSP4 IgG antibodies showed broad immuno-specificity in reacting against rPoMSP1 and rPoAMA1. Lastly, PocMSP4- and PowMSP4-immunized mice induced cellular immune responses with PocMSP4 (36%) and PowMSP4 cells (15.8%) during splenocyte proliferation assays. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study suggest conservation in PoMSP4 protein sequences and high immunogenicity was observed in rPoMSP4. Furthermore, induction of immune responses in PocMSP4- and PowMSP4-immunized mice informed that both humoral and cellular immune responses play crucial roles for PoMSP4 in protection.',\n",

Cd stress stimulated endogenous melatonin production to a greater extent in the Cd-tolerant M. baccata than in the Cd-susceptible M. micromalus â\\x80\\x98qingzhoulinqinâ\\x80\\x99. Melatonin application attenuated Cd-induced reductions in growth, photosynthesis, and enzyme activity, as well as ROS and MDA accumulation. Melatonin treatment more effectively restored photosynthesis, photosynthetic pigments, and biomass in Cd-challenged M. micromalus â\\x80\\x98qingzhoulinqinâ\\x80\\x99 than in Cd-stressed M. baccata. Exogenous melatonin lowered root Cd(2+) uptake, reduced leaf Cd accumulation, decreased Cd translocation factors (T(f)s), and increased root, stem, and leaf melatonin contents in both Cd-exposed rootstocks. Melatonin application increased both antioxidant concentrations and enzyme activities to scavenge Cd-induced ROS. Exogenous melatonin treatment altered the mRNA levels of several genes regulating Cd uptake, transport, and detoxification including HA7, NRAMP1, NRAMP3, HMA4, PCR2, NAS1, MT2, ABCC1, and MHX. Taken together, these results suggest that exogenous melatonin reduced aerial parts Cd accumulation and mitigated Cd toxicity in Malus plants, probably due to the melatonin-mediated Cd allocation in tissues, and induction of antioxidant defense system and transcriptionally regulated key genes involved in detoxification.',\n",

METHODS: To understand the epidemiology of HAdV infections in Singapore, we studied 533 HAdV-positive clinical samples collected from 396 pediatric and 137 adult patients in Singapore from 2012 to 2018. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed to identify HAdV genotypes, clonal clusters, and recombinant or novel HAdVs. RESULTS: The most prevalent genotypes identified were HAdV-B3 (35.6%), HAdV-B7 (15.4%), and HAdV-E4 (15.2%). We detected 4 new HAdV-C strains and detected incursions with HAdV-B7 (odds ratio [OR], 14.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1â\\x80\\x9352.0) and HAdV-E4 (OR, 13.6; 95% CI, 3.9â\\x80\\x9346.7) among pediatric patients over time. In addition, immunocompromised patients (adjusted OR [aOR], 11.4; 95% CI, 3.8â\\x80\\x9334.8) and patients infected with HAdV-C2 (aOR, 8.5; 95% CI, 1.5â\\x80\\x9348.0), HAdV-B7 (aOR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.2â\\x80\\x9310.9), or HAdV-E4 (aOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.1â\\x80\\x938.9) were at increased risk for severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: Singapore would benefit from more frequent studies of clinical HAdV genotypes to identify patients at risk for severe disease and help guide the use of new antiviral therapies, such as brincidofovir, and potential administration of HAdV 4 and 7 vaccine.',\n",
       " 'One of the key challenges in the field of genetics is the inference of haplotypes from next generation sequencing data. The MinION Oxford Nanopore sequencer allows sequencing long reads, with the potential of sequencing complete genes, and even complete genomes of viruses, in individual reads. However, MinION suffers from high error rates, rendering the detection of true variants difficult. Here, we propose a new statistical approach named AssociVar, which differentiates between true mutations and sequencing errors from direct RNA/DNA sequencing using MinION. Our strategy relies on the assumption that sequencing errors will be dispersed randomly along sequencing reads, and hence will not be associated with each other, whereas real mutations will display a non-random pattern of association with other mutations. We demonstrate our approach using direct RNA sequencing data from evolved populations of the MS2 bacteriophage, whose small genome makes it ideal for MinION sequencing. AssociVar inferred several mutations in the phage genome, which were corroborated using parallel Illumina sequencing. This allowed us to reconstruct full genome viral haplotypes constituting different strains that were present in the sample. Our approach is applicable to long read sequencing data from any organism for accurate detection of bona fide mutations and inter-strain polymorphisms.',\n",

We evaluated the RSV fusion inhibitor presatovir in a randomized, double-blind, Phase II trial in HCT recipients with RSV upper respiratory tract infections. METHODS: Patients were stratified by lymphopenia (<200/ÂµL) and ribavirin use; were randomized, stratified by lymphopenia (<200/Î¼L) and ribavirin use, to receive oral presatovir at 200 mg or a placebo on Days 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17, and were followed through Day 28. The coprimary efficacy endpoints were the time-weighted average change in the nasal RSV viral load between Days 1 and 9 and the proportion of patients developing lower respiratory tract complications (LRTCs) through Day 28. RESULTS: From 23 January 2015 to 16 June 2017, 189 patients were randomly assigned to treatment (96 to presatovir and 93 to the placebo). Presatovir treatment, compared with the placebo treatment, did not significantly affect (prespecified Î± = 0.01) a time-weighted average decline in the RSV viral load from Day 1 to 9 (treatment difference, â\\x88\\x920.33 log(10) copies/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] â\\x88\\x92.64 to â\\x88\\x92.02 log(10) copies/mL; P = .040) or the progression to LRTC (11.2% vs 19.5%, respectively; odds ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, .22â\\x80\\x931.18; P = .11). In a post hoc analysis among patients with lymphopenia, presatovir decreased LRTC development by Day 28 (2/15 [13.3%] vs 9/14 [64.3%], respectively; P = .008), compared with the placebo. Adverse events were similar for patients receiving presatovir and the placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Presatovir had a favorable safety profile in adult HCT recipients with RSV but did not achieve the coprimary endpoints. Exploratory analyses suggest an antiviral effect among patients with lymphopenia. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT02254408; EUDRA-CT#2014-002474-36.',\n",

METHODS: Data regarding patients aged â\\x89¥18 years admitted to any of Marylandâ\\x80\\x99s 50 acute-care hospitals were evaluated over 12 consecutive years (2001â\\x80\\x932013). We examined RSV and influenza (flu) surveillance data from the US National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and used this information to define RSV and flu outbreak periods in the Maryland area. Outbreak periods consisted of consecutive individual weeks during which at least 10% of RSV and/or flu diagnostic tests were positive. We examined relationships of RSV and flu outbreaks to occurrence of 4 advanced medical outcomes (hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, intubated mechanical ventilation, and death) due to medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI). RESULTS: Occurrences of all 4 MAARI-related hospital advanced medical outcomes were consistently greater for all adult ages during RSV, flu, and combined RSVâ\\x80\\x93flu outbreak periods compared to nonoutbreak periods and tended to be greatest in adults aged â\\x89¥65 years during combined RSVâ\\x80\\x93flu outbreak periods.

We evaluated presatovir in hematopoietic-cell transplant (HCT) recipients with RSV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). METHODS: Patients with confirmed RSV in upper and lower respiratory tract and new chest X-ray abnormalities were randomized (1:1), stratified by supplemental oxygen and ribavirin use, to receive oral presatovir 200 mg or placebo every 4 days for 5 doses. The primary endpoint was time-weighted average change in nasal RSV viral load through day 9. Secondary endpoints included supplemental oxygen-free days, incident respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: From January 31, 2015, to March 20, 2017, 60 patients from 17 centers were randomized (31 presatovir, 29 placebo); 59 received study treatment (50 allogeneic, 9 autologous HCT).

This study assessed the safety and efficacy of TG01/GM-CSF in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Patients with stage I or II pancreatic adenocarcinoma who had undergone surgical resection (R0 or R1) received adjuvant gemcitabine with TG01/GM-CSF using two schedules of vaccination. Immune response was defined as a positive delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response and/or positive T-cell proliferation assay. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were enrolled between February 2013 and May 2016. Nineteen were treated with the high antigen burden, with four serious adverse reactions considered possibly related to TG01 treatment, including three allergic reactions. On this basis, a further 13 patients received a modified vaccination schedule with reduced antigen burden, with no serious adverse events related to TG01. Ninety-five percent patients in the main cohort and 92% in the modified cohort had a positive immune response. Median overall survival (OS) was 33.1 months, and median disease-free survival (DFS) was 13.9 months for the main cohort. For the modified cohort, the median OS was 34.3 months and median DFS was 19.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: TG01/GM-CSF with gemcitabine was well tolerated, with high levels of immune activation.

       " 'The innate immune system plays a crucial role in the host defense against viral and microbial infection. Exosomes constitute a subset of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can be released by almost all cell types. Owing to their capacity to shield the payload from degradation and to evade recognition and subsequent removal by the immune system, exosomes efficiently transport functional components to recipient cells. Accumulating evidence has recently shown that exosomes derived from tumor cells, host cells and even bacteria and parasites mediate the communication between the invader and innate immune cells and thus play an irreplaceable function in the dissemination of pathogens and donor cell-derived molecules, modulating the innate immune responses of the host. In this review, we describe the current understanding of EVs (mainly focusing on exosomes) and summarize and discuss their crucial roles in determining innate immune responses. Additionally, we discuss the potential of using exosomes as biomarkers and cancer vaccines in diagnostic and therapeutic applications.',\n",
       " 'Gangliosides are structurally and functionally polymorphic sialic acid containing glycosphingolipids that are widely distributed in the human body. They play important roles in protecting us against immune attacks, yet they can become targets for autoimmunity and act as receptors for microbes, like the influenza viruses, and toxins, such as the cholera toxin. The expression patterns of gangliosides vary in different tissues, during different life periods, as well as in different animals. Antibodies against gangliosides (AGA) can target immune attack e.g., against neuronal cells and neutralize their complement inhibitory activity.

Significant efforts have been made to develop novel vaccines and therapeutics; however, the interaction of NDV with the host is not yet fully understood. Interferons (IFNs), an integral component of innate immune signaling, act as the first line of defense against invading viruses. Compared with the mammalian repertoire of IFNs, limited information is available on the antiviral potential of IFNs in chickens. Here, we expressed chicken IFN-Î³ (chIFN-Î³) using a baculovirus expression vector system, characterized its antiviral potential against NDV, and determined its antiviral potential. Priming of chicken embryo fibroblasts with chIFN-Î³ elicited an antiviral environment in primary cells, which was mainly due to interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). A genome-wide transcriptomics approach was used to elucidate the possible signaling pathways associated with IFN-Î³-induced immune responses. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed significant induction of ISG-associated pathways, activated temporal expression of ISGs, antiviral mediators, and transcriptional regulators in a cascade of antiviral responses. Collectively, we found that IFN-Î³ significantly elicited an antiviral response against NDV infection. These data provide a foundation for chIFN-Î³-mediated antiviral responses and underpin functional annotation of these important chIFN-Î³-induced antiviral influencers.',\n",

Surveying such phenomena helps to understand how nurses feel and behave when cancer care is provided. Besides, tracking the evolving nature of those three concepts can lend a hand for the early detection of personal and professional suffering of nurses while offering some healing remedies to their struggling bodies and souls. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the level of compassion fatigue, burn out and compassion satisfaction among a group of specialized oncology nurses. Besides, this study aimed to detect some probable interesting inferences between compassion satisfaction and the concept of rest and leisure. Correlations between compassion fatigue, burn out and compassion satisfaction were investigated. Correlations between oncology nursesâ\\x80\\x99 scores on the three subscales and a group of demographic, organizational and leisure-related variables were examined. METHODS: This study adopted a descriptive correlation design to survey compassion fatigue, burn out and compassion satisfaction among a convenient sample of 100 oncology nurses who work in a specialized cancer care centre. Participants completed compassion fatigue self-test developed by Figely (Compassion fatigue, New York: Brunner/Mazel. B. HudnallStamm, Traumatic Stress Research Group; 1995â\\x80\\x931998. http://www.dartmouth.edu/~bhstamm/index.htm, 1995) and a literature-based demographic survey. Analysis of data included descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation co-efficient. RESULTS: Nurses reported a low level of compassion satisfaction, moderate risk for burn out and an extremely high risk for compassion fatigue. Results revealed significant negative relationships among compassion satisfaction and the number of dependents per nurse. Additionally the correlation between compassion satisfaction and the nursesâ\\x80\\x99 number of hours slept was positive. Only two components of the concept rest and leisure yielded statistical significance when correlated to the concept of compassion satisfaction. A significant negative relationship was observed between compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue while a strong positive relationship was observed between compassion fatigue and burn out. CONCLUSIONS: The studied oncology nurses sample had evidently low level of compassion satisfaction when contrasted to the significantly increased risks of burn out and compassion fatigue. Thus, health authorities and management are advised to care, in a holistic approach, for nurses who work in oncology departments. Staff-oriented services that offer comfort, reward, leisure, screening, consultation and support are urgently recommended.',\n",

We examined this issue in patients with ARDS enrolled in the Large observational study to UNderstand the Global impact of Severe Acute respiratory FailurE (LUNG SAFE) study. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of the LUNG SAFE study, we wished to determine the prevalence and the outcomes associated with hyperoxemia on day 1, sustained hyperoxemia, and excessive oxygen use in patients with early ARDS. Patients who fulfilled criteria of ARDS on day 1 and day 2 of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure were categorized based on the presence of hyperoxemia (PaO(2) > 100 mmHg) on day 1, sustained (i.e., present on day 1 and day 2) hyperoxemia, or excessive oxygen use (FIO(2) â\\x89¥ 0.60 during hyperoxemia). RESULTS: Of 2005 patients that met the inclusion criteria, 131 (6.5%) were hypoxemic (PaO(2) < 55 mmHg), 607 (30%) had hyperoxemia on day 1, and 250 (12%) had sustained hyperoxemia. Excess FIO(2) use occurred in 400 (66%) out of 607 patients with hyperoxemia. Excess FIO(2) use decreased from day 1 to day 2 of ARDS, with most hyperoxemic patients on day 2 receiving relatively low FIO(2). Multivariate analyses found no independent relationship between day 1 hyperoxemia, sustained hyperoxemia, or excess FIO(2) use and adverse clinical outcomes. Mortality was 42% in patients with excess FIO(2) use, compared to 39% in a propensity-matched sample of normoxemic (PaO(2) 55â\\x80\\x93100 mmHg) patients (P = 0.47). CONCLUSIONS: Hyperoxemia and excess oxygen use are both prevalent in early ARDS but are most often non-sustained.

       " 'Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne disease caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection. Despite a gradual increase of SFTS cases and high mortality in endemic regions, no specific viral therapy nor vaccine is available. Here, we developed a single recombinant plasmid DNA encoding SFTSV genes, Gn and Gc together with NP-NS fusion antigen, as a vaccine candidate. The viral antigens were fused with Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3L) and IL-12 gene was incorporated into the plasmid to enhance cell-mediated immunity. Vaccination with the DNA provides complete protection of IFNAR KO mice upon lethal SFTSV challenge, whereas immunization with a plasmid without IL-12 gene resulted in partial protection. Since we failed to detect antibodies against surface glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, in the immunized mice, antigen-specific cellular immunity, as confirmed by enhanced antigen-specific T cell responses, might play major role in protection. Finally, we evaluated the degree of protective immunity provided by protein immunization of the individual glycoprotein, Gn or Gc. Although both protein antigens induced a significant level of neutralizing activity against SFTSV, Gn vaccination resulted in relatively higher neutralizing activity and better protection than Gc vaccination. However, both antigens failed to provide complete protection. Given that DNA vaccines have failed to induce sufficient immunogenicity in human trials when compared to protein vaccines, optimal combinations of DNA and protein elements, proper selection of target antigens, and incorporation of efficient adjuvant, need to be further investigated for SFTSV vaccine development.',\n",

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, Georgia USA) was one of many public health organizations that sought to stop this outbreak. This agency deployed almost 2,000 individuals to West Africa during that timeframe. Deployment to these countries exposed these individuals to a wide variety of dangers, stressors, and risks. Being concerned about the at-risk populations in Africa, and also the well-being of its professionals who willingly deployed, the CDC did several things to help safeguard the health, safety, and resilience of these team members before, during, and after deployment. The accompanying special report highlights innovative pre-deployment training initiatives, customized screening processes, and post-deployment outreach efforts intended to protect and support the public health professionals fighting Ebola. Before deploying, the CDC team members were expected to participate in both internally-created and externally-provided trainings. These ranged from pre-deployment briefings, to Preparing for Work Overseas (PFWO) and Public Health Readiness Certificate Program (PHRCP) courses, to Incident Command System (ICS) 100, 200, and 400 courses. A small subset of non-clinical deployers also participated in a three-day training designed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress (CSTS; Bethesda, Maryland USA) to train individuals to assess and address the well-being and resilience of themselves and their teammates in the field during a deployment. Participants in this unique training were immersed in a Virtual Reality Environment (VRE) that simulated deployment to one of seven different types of emergencies. The CDC leadership also requested a pre-deployment screening process that helped professionals in the CDCâ\\x80\\x99s Occupational Health Clinic (OHC) determine whether or not individuals were at an increased risk of negative outcomes by participating in a rigorous deployment at that time. When deployers returned from the field, they received personalized invitations to participate in a voluntary, confidential, post-deployment operational debriefing one-on-one or in a group. Implementing these approaches provided more information to clinical decision makers about the readiness of deployers. It provided deployers with a greater awareness of the kinds of challenges they were likely to face in the field.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccine manufacturers traditionally use egg-derived candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) to produce high-yield influenza viruses for seasonal or pandemic vaccines; however, these egg-derived CVVs need an adaptation process for the virus to grow in mammalian cells. The low yields of cell-based manufacturing systems using egg-derived CVVs remain an unsolved issue. This study aimed to develop high-growth cell-derived CVVs for MDCK cell-based vaccine manufacturing platforms. METHODS: Four H7N9 CVVs were generated in characterized Vero and adherent MDCK (aMDCK) cells. Furthermore, reassortant viruses were amplified in adherent MDCK (aMDCK) cells with certification, and their growth characteristics were detected in aMDCK cells and new suspension MDCK (sMDCK) cells. Finally, the plaque-forming ability, biosafety, and immunogenicity of H7N9 reassortant viruses were evaluated. RESULTS: The HA titers of these CVVs produced in proprietary suspension MDCK (sMDCK) cells and chicken embryos were 2- to 8-fold higher than those in aMDCK cells. All H7N9 CVVs showed attenuated characteristics by trypsin-dependent plaque assay and chicken embryo lethality test. The alum-adjuvanted NHRI-RG5 (derived from the fifth wave H7N9 virus A/Guangdong/SP440/2017) vaccine had the highest immunogenicity and cross-reactivity among the four H7N9 CVVs. Finally, we found that AddaVax adjuvant improved the cross-reactivity of low pathogenic H7N9 virus against highly pathogenic H7N9 viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that cell-derived H7N9 CVVs possessed high growth rate in new sMDCK cells and low pathogenicity in chicken embryo, and that CVVs generated by this platform are also suitable for both cell- and egg-based prepandemic vaccine production.',\n",
       " 'Campaigns to eliminate infectious diseases could be greatly aided by methods for providing early warning signals of resurgence. Theory predicts that as a disease transmission system undergoes a transition from stability at the disease-free equilibrium to sustained transmission, it will exhibit characteristic behaviours known as critical slowing down, referring to the speed at which fluctuations in the number of cases are dampened, for instance the extinction of a local transmission chain after infection from an imported case. These phenomena include increases in several summary statistics, including lag-1 autocorrelation, variance and the first difference of variance. Here, we report the first empirical test of this prediction during the resurgence of malaria in Kericho, Kenya. For 10 summary statistics, we measured the approach to criticality in a rolling window to quantify the size of effect and directions. Nine of the statistics increased as predicted and variance, the first difference of variance, autocovariance, lag-1 autocorrelation and decay time returned early warning signals of critical slowing down based on permutation tests. These results show that time series of disease incidence collected through ordinary surveillance activities may exhibit characteristic signatures prior to an outbreak, a phenomenon that may be quite general among infectious disease systems.',\n",
       " 'Existing methods to infer the relative roles of age groups in epidemic transmission can normally only accommodate a few age classes, and/or require data that are highly specific for the disease being studied. Here, symbolic transfer entropy (STE), a measure developed to identify asymmetric transfer of information between stochastic processes, is presented as a way to reveal asymmetric transmission patterns between age groups in an epidemic. STE provides a ranking of which age groups may dominate transmission, rather than a reconstruction of the explicit between-age-group transmission matrix. Using simulations, we establish that STE can identify which age groups dominate transmission even when there are differences in reporting rates between age groups and even if the data are noisy. Then, the pairwise STE is calculated between time series of influenza-like illness for 12 age groups in 884 US cities during the autumn of 2009. Elevated STE from 5 to 19 year-olds indicates that school-aged children were likely the most important transmitters of infection during the autumn wave of the 2009 pandemic in the USA. The results may be partially confounded by higher rates of physician-seeking behaviour in children compared to adults, but it is unlikely that differences in reporting rates can explain the observed differences in STE.',\n",
       " 'There is increasing interest in the development of new, â\\x80\\x98universalâ\\x80\\x99 influenza vaccines (UIVs) thatâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x93unlike current vaccinesâ\\x80\\x93â\\x80\\x93are effective against a broad range of seasonal influenza strains, as well as against novel pandemic viruses. While the existing literature discusses the potential epidemiological benefits of UIVs, it is also important to anticipate their potential unintended population consequences. Using mathematical modelling, we illustrate two such types of adverse consequences. First, by reducing the amount of infection-induced immunity in a population without fully replacing it, a seasonal UIV programme may permit larger pandemics than in the absence of vaccination. Second, the more successful a future UIV programme is in reducing transmission of seasonal influenza, the more vulnerable the population could become to the emergence of a vaccine escape variant. These risks could be mitigated by optimal deployment of any future UIV vaccine: namely, the use of a combined vaccine formulation (incorporating conventional as well as multiple universal antigenic targets) and achieving sufficient population coverage to compensate for any reductions in infection-induced immunity. In the absence of large-scale trials of UIVs, disease-dynamic models can provide helpful, early insights into their potential impact. In future, data from continuing vaccine development will be invaluable in developing robustly predictive modelling approaches.',\n",
       " 'In order to monitor progress towards malaria elimination, it is crucial to be able to measure changes in spatio-temporal transmission. However, common metrics of malaria transmission such as parasite prevalence are under powered in elimination contexts. China has achieved major reductions in malaria incidence and is on track to eliminate, having reporting zero locally-acquired malaria cases in 2017 and 2018. Understanding the spatio-temporal pattern underlying this decline, especially the relationship between locally-acquired and imported cases, can inform efforts to maintain elimination and prevent re-emergence. This is particularly pertinent in Yunnan province, where the potential for local transmission is highest. Using a geo-located individual-level dataset of cases recorded in Yunnan province between 2011 and 2016, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework to model a latent diffusion process and estimate the joint likelihood of transmission between cases and the number of cases with unobserved sources of infection. This is used to estimate the case reproduction number, Rc. We use these estimates within spatio-temporal geostatistical models to map how transmission varied over time and space, estimate the timeline to elimination and the risk of resurgence. We estimate the mean Rc between 2011 and 2016 to be 0.171 (95% CI = 0.165, 0.178) for P. vivax cases and 0.089 (95% CI = 0.076, 0.103) for P. falciparum cases. From 2014 onwards, no cases were estimated to have a Rc value above one. An unobserved source of infection was estimated to be moderately likely (p>0.5) for 19/ 611 cases and high (p>0.8) for 2 cases, suggesting very high levels of case ascertainment. Our estimates suggest that, maintaining current intervention efforts, Yunnan is unlikely to experience sustained local transmission up to 2020. However, even with a mean of 0.005 projected up to 2020, locally-acquired cases are possible due to high levels of importation.',\n",

       " 'Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) can cure both children and adults with sickle cell disease. Outcomes have historically been poor for the vast majority of patients who lack a matched sibling donor. However, the development of haploidentical HCT (haplo-HCT) with high doses of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has allowed for curative long-term potential with favorable transplant-related outcomes, though this has not obviated the potential for graft rejection from human leukocyte antigen mismatch and repeated red blood cell transfusions. Accordingly, multiple strategies have been developed to improve outcomes, the majority of which are based on the Johns Hopkins platform from 2012. Presently, we aim to discuss results from pertinent studies and compare outcomes with the two most recent approaches involving either thiotepa plus 200-cGy total body irradiation or 400-cGy total body irradiation. Direct comparisons are required to determine the optimized curative potential. Transplant-eligible patients must be referred to tertiary medical centers for consideration of haplo-HCT.',\n",

This qualitative study employs a social-ecological framework to examine how macro (historical, legislative, political, socio-economic factors), meso (sources of information, social support, social mobilization) and micro level factors (individual actions, behavioral changes) interacted to influence the response and behavior of women with respect to Zika in different contexts. METHODS: A qualitative study was carried out. Women were recruited through the snowball sampling technique from various locations in Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the United States. They were of different nationalities and ethnicities. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews. The data transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Women in this study deemed the information provided as insufficient, which led them to actively reach out and access a variety of media sources. Social networks played a vital role in sharing information but also resulted in the spread of hoaxes or rumors. Participants in our research perceived socio-economic inequities but focused on how to remedy their microenvironments. They did not engage in major social activities. Lack of trust in governments placed women in vulnerable situations by preventing them to follow the guidance of health authorities. These impacts were also a result of the response tactics of health and government administrations in their failed attempts to ensure the well-being of their countriesâ\\x80\\x99 populations.

Templates, designed through expert agreement, are valuable and feasible, but they need to be updated on a regular basis due to developments in available equipment and treatment options. In 2011, a consensus-based template documenting and reporting data in p-EMS was published. We aimed to revise and update the template for documenting and reporting in p-EMS. METHODS: A Delphi method was applied to achieve a consensus from a panel of selected European experts. The experts were blinded to each other until a consensus was reached, and all responses were anonymized. The experts were asked to propose variables within five predefined sections. There was also an optional sixth section for variables that did not fit into the pre-defined sections. Experts were asked to review and rate all variables from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree) based on relevance, and consensus was defined as variables rated â\\x89¥4 by more than 70% of the experts. RESULTS: Eleven experts participated. The experts generated 194 unique variables in the first round. After five rounds, a consensus was reached.

       " 'Chromatin dynamics regulated by epigenetic modification is crucial in genome stability and gene expression. Various epigenetic mechanisms have been identified in the pathogenesis of human diseases. Here, we examined the effects of ten epigenetic agents on pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection by using GFP-reporter assays. Inhibitors of bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4), which receives much more attention in cancer than viral infection, was found to exhibit substantial anti-viral activity against PRV as well as a range of DNA and RNA viruses. We further demonstrated that BRD4 inhibition boosted a robust innate immune response. BRD4 inhibition also de-compacted chromatin structure and induced the DNA damage response, thereby triggering the activation of cGAS-mediated innate immunity and increasing host resistance to viral infection both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the inhibitory effect of BRD4 inhibition on viral infection was mainly attributed to the attenuation of viral attachment. Our findings reveal a unique mechanism through which BRD4 inhibition restrains viral infection and points to its potent therapeutic value for viral infectious diseases.',\n",

Despite their predictive ability, current algorithmic approaches and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-peptidomic analysis allow limited selectivity. Here, we optimized a method to rapidly screen and identify highly immunogenic epitopes that trigger CTL responses. We used a combined application of this method involving immune-specific signature analysis and HLA-associated peptidomics using samples from six patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in order to select immunogenic HLA epitopes for in vitro testing. Additionally, we applied high-throughput imaging at the single-cell level in order to confirm the immunoreactivity of the selected peptides. The results indicated that this method enabled identification of promising CTL peptides capable of inducing antitumor immunity. This platform combining high-resolution computational analysis, HLA-peptidomics, and high-throughput immunogenicity testing allowed rapid and robust identification of highly immunogenic epitopes and represents a powerful technique for cancer-vaccine development.',\n",
       " 'Epidemics and evolution of many pathogens occur on similar timescales so that their dynamics are often entangled. Here, in a first step to study this problem theoretically, we analyze mutating pathogens spreading on simple SIR networks with grid-like connectivity. We have in mind the spatial aspect of epidemics, which often advance on transport links between hosts or groups of hosts such as cities or countries. We focus on the case of mutations that enhance an agentâ\\x80\\x99s infection rate. We uncover that the small-world property, i.e., the presence of long-range connections, makes the network very vulnerable, supporting frequent supercritical mutations and bringing the network from disease extinction to full blown epidemic. For very large numbers of long-range links, however, the effect reverses and we find a reduced chance for large outbreaks. We study two cases, one with discrete number of mutational steps and one with a continuous genetic variable, and we analyze various scaling regimes. For the continuous case we derive a Fokker-Planck-like equation for the probability density and solve it for small numbers of shortcuts using the WKB approximation. Our analysis supports the claims that a potentiating mutation in the transmissibility might occur during an epidemic wave and not necessarily before its initiation.',\n",

Molecular docking was used to predict binding models between curcumin derivatives and neuraminidase. Real-time polymerase chain reactions showed that the five active curcumin derivatives might have direct effects on viral particle infectivity in H1N1-infected lung epithelial (MDCK) cells. Neuraminidase activation assay showed that five active curcumin derivatives decreased H1N1-induced neuraminidase activation in MDCK cells. Indirect immunofluorescence assay indicated that two active curcumin derivatives (tetramethylcurcumin and curcumin) down-regulated the nucleoprotein expression. Curcumin inhibited IAV in vivo. The therapeutic mechanism of curcumin in the treatment of influenza viral pneumonia is related to improving the immune function of infected mice and regulating secretion of tumor necrosis-Î±, interleukin-6, and interferon-Î³. These results indicate that curcumin derivatives inhibit IAV by blocking neuraminidase in the cellular model and curcumin also has anti-IAV activity in the animal model.',\n",

       " 'In transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) of piglets, an infection closely resembling human rotavirus enteritis, we studied the timing and extent of epithelial viral invasion along the small intestine after a single oral inoculum of virus; we related these findings to measured alterations in mucosal structure, kinetics, and differentiation, and to previously documented abnormalities of ion transport that occurred at the height of diarrhea. Six and twelve hours after inoculation, before diarrhea, extensive specific viral immunofluorescence and viral particles on electron microscopy were seen in villus but not crypt enterocytes in jejunum, mid-intestine, and ileum. At 24 and 40 hr, when diarrhea was most severe, immunofluorescence was patchy; villus blunting (P < 0.001) and increased crypt depth (P < 0.001) were observed by light microscopy in all segments; radioautographically labeled enterocytes showed accelerated migration and shortened life span; and cells on villi were deficient in sucrose activity (P < 0.001) and rich in thymidine kinase activity (P < 0.005), suggesting relative immaturity. Villus structure recovered by 72 and 144 hr, although deeper crypts (P < 0.001) and accelerated migration still persisted. We conclude that extensive, almost simultaneous direct viral invasion of villus enterocytes can occur along the entire length of the small intestine after a single exposure to virus, and thus can cause shedding of mature villus cells and proliferation and accelerated migration of cells from the crypts. At the height of diarrhea, when enterocyte turnover is maximal, the epithelium consists predominantly of immature virus-free cells which have migrated to the villi in a relatively undifferentiated state.',\n",
       " 'To understand mechanisms of viral diarrhea further, we studied ileal ion transport in vitro in relation to mucosal changes and epithelial differentiation in transmissible gastroenteritis in piglets, an invasive viral enteritis thought to involve mainly proximal intestine. In infected pigs, at the height of diarrhea, short-circuited ileal epithelium failed actively to transport Na(+) and Cl(â\\x88\\x92), and there was a defect of glucose-mediated Na(+) transport. The Cl(â\\x88\\x92) secretory response to theophylline remained intact. Conductance measurements indicate that paracellular permeability may be reduced and transcellular transport may be altered. A mucosal lesion was observed at the time of the transport changes, characterized by villus blunting, crypt hyperplasia, and immature crypt-type enterocytes on the villus epithelium, deficient in disaccharidase and (Na(+), K(+))ATPase activity but rich in thymidine kinase. Consideration of the major determinants of diarrhea in this invasive enteritis must take into account not only altered mucosal function and differentiation but also the extent of intestinal involvement, including the ileum, a major site of fluid absorption in the intestine.',\n",
       " 'Absorption of water and electrolytes by the small and large intestine was examined using a nonabsorbable marker technique in 3-day-old and 3-wkold pigs. One-half of the pigs in each group were orally infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus; the remaining pigs served as controls. Threeday-old control pigs concentrated the nonabsorbable fluid marker twelve f old along the small and large intestine, indicating an efficiency of about 95% in absorption of the exogenous daily fluid load presented to the intestine. In contrast, the marker concentration in infected pigs showed no change whatsoever along either the small or large intestine, indicating a complete absence of net fluid absorption or secretion in these animals. Three-week-old control pigs concentrated the marker similarly to the 3-day-old group, with the bulk of the fluid absorption occurring in the small intestine. Infected pigs in the 3-wk-old group had marked net fluid secretion in the proximal small intestine, so that about twice the fluid load was presented to the large intestine of the 3-wk-old infected pigs as compared to the 3-day-old infected group. However, in contrast to the 3-day-old infected group, the large intestine of the 3-wk-old infected pigs increased fluid absorption some six times over the control, and this compensatory response prevented diarrhea in these older animals. Analysis of luminal contents indicated that in the older pigs, unabsorbed carbohydrate was almost completely fermented to short-chain fatty acids in the colon, whereas in the younger pigs the carbohydrate passed through the colon unchanged. These results demonstrate that development of microbial digestion, together with rapid short-chain fatty acid absorption, is a primary feature responsible for the colonic compensation in the older pigs with transmissible gastroenteritis.',\n",

       " 'Serine repeat antigen (SERA) is conserved among species of the genus Plasmodium. Sera genes form a multigene family and are generally tandemly clustered on a single chromosome. Although all Plasmodium species encode multiple sera genes, the number varies between species. Among species, the members share similar sequences and gene organization. SERA possess a central papain-like cysteine protease domain, however, in some members, the active site cysteine residue is substituted with a serine. Recent studies implicate this gene family in a number of aspects in parasite biology and induction of protective immune response. This review summarizes the current understanding on this important gene family in several Plasmodium species. The Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)-sera family, for example, consists of nine gene members. Unlike other multigene families in Plasmodium species, Pf-sera genes do not exhibit antigenic variation. Pf-sera5 nucleotide diversity is also low. Moreover, although Pf-sera5 is highly transcribed during the blood stage of malaria infection, and a large amount is released into the host blood following schizont rupture, in malaria endemic countries the sero-positive rates for Pf-SERA5 are low, likely due to Pf-SERA5 binding of host proteins to avoid immune recognition. As an antigen, the N-terminal 47 kDa domain of Pf-SERA5 is a promising vaccine candidate currently undergoing clinical trials. Pf-SERA5 and Pf-SERA6, as well as P. berghei (Pb)-SERA3, and Pb-SERA5, have been investigated for their roles in parasite egress. Two P. yoelii SERA, which have a serine residue at the protease active center, are implicated in parasite virulence. Overall, these studies provide insight that during the evolution of the Plasmodium parasite, the sera gene family members have increased by gene duplication, and acquired various functions that enable the parasite to survive and successfully maintain infection in the host.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Predicting the details of how an epidemic evolves is highly valuable as health institutions need to better plan towards limiting the infection propagation effects and optimizing their prediction and response capabilities. Simulation is a cost- and time-effective way of predicting the evolution of the infection as the joint influence of many different factors: interaction patterns, personal characteristics, travel patterns, meteorological conditions, previous vaccination, etc. The work presented in this paper extends EpiGraph, our influenza epidemic simulator, by introducing a meteorological model as a modular component that interacts with the rest of EpiGraphâ\\x80\\x99s modules to refine our previous simulation results. Our goal is to estimate the effects of changes in temperature and relative humidity on the patterns of epidemic influenza based on data provided by the Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System (SISSS) and the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET). METHODS: Our meteorological model is based on the regression model developed by AB and JS, and it is tuned with influenza surveillance data obtained from SISSS. After pre-processing this data to clean it and reconstruct missing samples, we obtain new values for the reproduction number of each urban region in Spain, every 10 minutes during 2011. We simulate the propagation of the influenza by setting the date of the epidemic onset and the initial influenza-illness rates for each urban region. RESULTS: We show that the simulation results have the same propagation shape as the weekly influenza rates as recorded by SISSS. We perform experiments for a realistic scenario based on actual meteorological data from 2010-2011, and for synthetic values assumed under simplified predicted climate change conditions. Results show that a diminishing relative humidity of 10% produces an increment of about 1.6% in the final infection rate. The effect of temperature changes on the infection spread is also noticeable, with a decrease of 1.1% per extra degree.Conclusions: Using a tool like ours could help predict the shape of developing epidemics and its peaks, and would permit to quickly run scenarios to determine the evolution of the epidemic under different conditions.

Six nursing home norovirus outbreaks occurring in South Carolina, U.S. from 2014 to 2016 were examined. We aimed to quantify the contribution of symptoms and other case characteristics in norovirus transmission using the reproduction number (R(Ei)) as an estimate of individual case infectivity and to examine how transmission changes over the course of an outbreak. Individual estimates of R(Ei) were calculated using a maximum likelihood procedure to infer the average number of secondary cases generated by each case. The associations between case characteristics and R(Ei) were estimated using a weighted multivariate mixed linear model. Outbreaks began with one to three index case(s) with large estimated R(Ei)â\\x80\\x99s (range: 1.48 to 8.70) relative to subsequent cases. Of the 209 cases, 155 (75%) vomited, 164 (79%) had diarrhea, and 158 (76%) were nursing home residents (vs. staff). Cases who vomited infected 2.12 (95% CI: 1.68, 2.68) times the number of individuals as non-vomiters, cases with diarrhea infected 1.39 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.87) times the number of individuals as cases without diarrhea, and resident-cases infected 1.53 (95% CI: 1.15, 2.02) times the number of individuals as staff-cases. Index cases tended to be residents (vs. staff) who vomited and infected considerably more secondary cases compared to non-index cases. Results suggest that individuals, particularly residents, who vomit are more infectious and tend to drive norovirus transmission in U.S. nursing home norovirus outbreaks. While diarrhea also plays a role in norovirus transmission, it is to a lesser degree than vomiting in these settings. Results lend support for prevention and control measures that focus on cases who vomit, particularly if those cases are residents.',\n",

Here, we evaluated whether HBV RNA could act as an early monitor of pegylated interferon responses. METHODS: We analyzed a phase 3, multicenter, randomized cohort of 727 HBeAg-positive non-cirrhotic patients receiving a 48-week treatment of PegIFNÎ±-2a or PegIFNÎ±-2b and a 24-week treatment-free follow-up. Serum levels of HBV RNA, HBV DNA, HBeAg, and HBsAg were measured at weeks 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72. RESULTS: HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss at week 72 were observed in 217 (29.8%) and 21 (2.9%) patients, respectively. During the 48-week treatment, HBV RNA decreased more rapidly than HBV DNA and HBsAg, but HBV RNA and HBeAg shared similar dynamics with positive correlations. Multivariate regression analyses consistently revealed the significance of HBV RNA at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 48 to monitor HBeAg seroconversion but not HBsAg loss. Although baseline HBV RNA only showed a modest AUC performance, HBV RNA with a significant increase of AUC at week 12 outperformed other HBV biomarkers to forecast HBeAg seroconversion (p value < 0.05). HBV RNA â\\x89¤ 1000 copies/mL was an optimized cutoff at week 12 that offered better prediction than other HBV biomarkers. This optimized cutoff plus patient age, HBV genotype B, and HBeAg offered a strong estimation of HBeAg seroconversion (accuracy 95.2%, true negative rate 99.8%). CONCLUSION: HBV RNA at week 12 is an effective monitor of HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive patients treated with pegylated interferons.

METHODS: The SAC (3 pediatric rheumatologists and 2 pediatric infectious disease specialists) elaborated and approved by consensus a provisional list of OI for use in JIA. Through a 5 step-procedure, all the severe and serious infections, classified as per MedDRA dictionary and retrieved in the Pharmachild registry, were evaluated by the SAC by answering six questions and adjudicated with the agreement of 3/5 specialists. A final evidence-based list of OI resulted by matching the adjudicated infections with the provisional list of OI. RESULTS: A total of 772 infectious events in 572 eligible patients, of which 335 serious/severe/very severe non-OI and 437 OI (any intensity/severity), according to the provisional list, were retrieved. Six hundred eighty-two of 772 (88.3%) were adjudicated as infections, of them 603/682 (88.4%) as common and 119/682 (17.4%) as OI by the SAC. Matching these 119 opportunistic events with the provisional list, 106 were confirmed by the SAC as OI, and among them infections by herpes viruses were the most frequent (68%), followed by tuberculosis (27.4%). The remaining events were divided in the groups of non-OI and possible/patient and/or pathogen-related OI.

We hypothesized that decreased serum S1P level is associated with the clinical outcomes of ARDS and polymorphisms in the S1P gene are associated with serum S1P levels. METHODS: This multicenter prospective study includes ARDS patients and healthy blood donors as controls. Serum S1P levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Eight tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the S1P gene were detected, and their associations with S1P levels were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 121 ARDS patients and 100 healthy individuals were enrolled. Serum S1P levels were lower in ARDS patients than in controls (P < 0.001). Decreased S1P levels correlated with more organ dysfunction and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores. Changes in S1P levels in ARDS patients were associated with the clinical outcomes. The recessive model for SNP rs3743631 suggests that GG homozygote is associate with a higher risk for ARDS. The dominant model for SNP rs907045 suggests that AA or TA genotype might increase the risk for ARDS. In ARDS patients, the rs3743631 GG genotype showed lower S1P levels than those harboring AG and AA genotypes. The serum S1P levels of rs907045 AA or TA genotype patients were lower than those of TT genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Serum S1P levels are dramatically decreased in ARDS patients.

Here, the genetic diversity of PvHAP2 was studied in Plasmodium vivax parasite populations from the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). METHODS: Plasmodium vivax clinical isolates were collected in clinics from the China-Myanmar border region (135 samples), western Thailand (41 samples) and western Myanmar (51 samples). Near full-length Pvhap2 (nucleotides 13â\\x80\\x932574) was amplified and sequenced from these isolates. Molecular evolution studies were conducted to evaluate the genetic diversity, selection and population differentiation. RESULTS: Sequencing of the pvhap2 gene for a total of 227 samples from the three P. vivax populations revealed limited genetic diversity of this gene in the GMS (Ï\\x80 = 0.00036 Â± 0.00003), with the highest Ï\\x80 value observed in Myanmar (0.00053 Â± 0.00009). Y133S was the dominant mutation in the China-Myanmar border (99.26%), Myanmar (100%) and Thailand (95.12%). Results of all neutrality tests were negative for all the three populations, suggesting the possible action of purifying selection. Codon-based tests identified specific codons which are under purifying or positive selections. Wrightâ\\x80\\x99s fixation index showed low to moderate genetic differentiation of P. vivax populations in the GMS, with F(ST) ranging from 0.04077 to 0.24833, whereas high levels of genetic differentiation were detected between the China-Myanmar border and Iran populations (F(ST) = 0.60266), and between Thailand and Iran populations (F(ST) = 0.44161). A total of 20 haplotypes were identified, with H2 being the abundant haplotype in China-Myanmar border, Myanmar and Thailand populations. Epitope mapping prediction of Pvhap2 antigen showed that high-score B-cell epitopes are located in the S307-G324, L429-P453 and V623-D637 regions. The E317K and D637N mutations located within S307-G324 and V623-D637 epitopes slightly reduced the predicted score for potential epitopes. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed a very low level of genetic diversity of pvhap2 gene among P. vivax populations in the Greater Mekong Subregion. The relative conservation of pvhap2 supports further evaluation of a Pvhap2-based TBV. [Image: see text]',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonotic disease which is a major challenge for clinicians and public health professionals in tropical countries. The cytokine storm during the second (immune) phase is thought to be a major contributory factor for the leptospirosis disease severity. We aim to summarize evidence for cytokine response in leptospirosis at different clinical outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review was carried out to examine the cytokine response in leptospirosis patients using relevant scientific databases. Reference lists of the selected articles were also screened. Quality of the selected studies was assessed by using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. RESULTS: Of the 239 articles retrieved in the initial search, 18 studies fulfilled the selection criteria. India and Thailand have produced the highest number of studies (17% each, n = 3). The majority were comparative cross-sectional studies (72%, n = 13). Overall the quality of the selected studies was fair regardless of few drawbacks such as reporting of sample size and the lack of adjustment for confounders. Microscopic agglutination test (67% - 12/18) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (50% - 9/18) were commonly used for the confirmation of leptospirosis and the measurement of cytokines respectively. IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-Î± levels were found to be significantly higher in severe than in mild leptospirosis. There were equivocal findings on the association between IL-1Î², TNF-Î± and IL-10/TNF-Î± ratio and disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis had a wide-range of elevated cytokines. However, prospective studies in-relation to the onset of the symptom are required to better understand the pathophysiology of cytokine response in leptospirosis.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Subphenotypes were recently reported within clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with distinct outcomes and therapeutic responses. Experimental models have long been used to mimic features of ARDS pathophysiology, but the presence of distinct subphenotypes among preclinical ARDS remains unknown. This review will investigate whether: 1) subphenotypes can be identified among preclinical ARDS models; 2) such subphenotypes can identify some responsive traits. METHODS: We will include comparative preclinical (in vivo and ex vivo) ARDS studies published between 2009 and 2019 in which pre-specified therapies were assessed (interleukin (IL)-10, IL-2, stem cells, beta-agonists, corticosteroids, fibroblast growth factors, modulators of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products pathway, anticoagulants, and halogenated agents) and outcomes compared to a control condition. The primary outcome will be a composite of the four key features of preclinical ARDS as per the American Thoracic Society consensus conference (histologic evidence of lung injury, altered alveolar-capillary barrier, lung inflammatory response, and physiological dysfunction). Secondary outcomes will include the single components of the primary composite outcome, net alveolar fluid clearance, and death. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases will be searched electronically and data from eligible studies will be extracted, pooled, and analyzed using random-effects models. Individual study reporting will be assessed according to the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments guidelines. Meta-regressions will be performed to identify subphenotypes prior to comparing outcomes across subphenotypes and treatment effects. DISCUSSION: This study will inform on the presence and underlying pathophysiological features of subphenotypes among preclinical models of ARDS and should help to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to perform preclinical trials of subphenotype-targeted therapies, prior to potential clinical translation.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Scrub typhus is an acute febrile illness, which was caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi and transmitted through the bite of chiggers. The diagnosis of scrub typhus could be missed diagnosis due to the absence of the pathognomonic eschar. CASE PRESENTATION: A 76-year-old man was hospitalized with fever and kidney injury and was diagnosed of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome first. However, the situation of the illness deteriorated into refractory septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction rapidly,although the treatment of anti-sepsis was used in 3rd-5th day. Orientia tsutsugamushi was determined to be the causative pathogen by Next-generation sequencing of his plasma sample in 6th day. Then, the patient was treated with doxycycline and azithromycin and recovered quickly. CONCLUSIONS: Next-generation sequencing was a new diagnostic technology and could identify scrub typhus in accurately and fast without the pathognomonic eschar.',\n",

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by SFTS virus. No countermeasures against the disease exist. In this report, we show an efficient method using virus-like particles for the functional screening of a cellular cDNA library to identify SFTS virus entry factors. Two variants encoding dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin related (DC-SIGNR), a calcium-dependent lectin known to enhance SFTS virus infection, were successfully identified from a human liver cDNA library. We will discuss applications for yet unidentified factor(s) for SFTS virus entry and for entry factor(s) for other viruses related to SFTS virus.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Pendelluft, the movement of gas within different lung regions, is present in animal models of assisted mechanical ventilation and associated with lung overstretching. Due to rebreathing of CO(2) as compared to fresh gas, pendelluft might reduce ventilatory efficiency possibly exacerbating patientâ\\x80\\x99s respiratory workload during weaning. Our aim was to measure pendelluft by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in patients who failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). METHODS: This is an observational study conducted in a general intensive care unit of a tertiary-level teaching hospital. EIT signal was recorded in 20 patients while pressure support (PS) ventilation was progressively reduced from clinical level (baseline) to 2 cmH(2)O, as in an SBT; four ventral-to-dorsal lung regions of interest were identified for pendelluft measurement. A regional gas movement (> 6 mL) occurring in a direction opposite to the global EIT signal was considered diagnostic for high pendelluft. RESULTS: Eight patients out of 20 (40%) were classified as high-pendelluft; baseline clinical characteristics did not differ between high- and low-pendelluft patients. At PS reduction, pendelluft and EtCO(2) increased more in the high-pendelluft group (p < .001 and .011, respectively). The volume of gas subject to pendelluft moved almost completely from the ventral towards the dorsal lung regions, while the opposite movement was minimal (16.3 [10:32.8] vs. 0 [0:1.8] mL, p = .001). In a subgroup of patients, increased pendelluft volumes positively correlated with markers of respiratory distress such as increased respiratory rate, p0.1, and EtCO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Occult pendelluft can be measured by EIT, and is frequently present in patients failing an SBT. When present, pendelluft increases with the reduction of ventilator support and is associated with increased EtCO(2), suggesting a reduction of the ability to eliminate CO(2).',\n",

       " 'DNA glycosylases are emerging as relevant pharmacological targets in inflammation, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, the search for inhibitors of these enzymes has become a very active research field. As a continuation of previous work that showed that 2-thioxanthine (2TX) is an irreversible inhibitor of zinc finger (ZnF)-containing Fpg/Nei DNA glycosylases, we designed and synthesized a mini-library of 2TX-derivatives (TXn) and evaluated their ability to inhibit Fpg/Nei enzymes. Among forty compounds, four TXn were better inhibitors than 2TX for Fpg. Unexpectedly, but very interestingly, two dithiolated derivatives more selectively and efficiently inhibit the zincless finger (ZnLF)-containing enzymes (human and mimivirus Neil1 DNA glycosylases hNeil1 and MvNei1, respectively). By combining chemistry, biochemistry, mass spectrometry, blind and flexible docking and X-ray structure analysis, we localized new TXn binding sites on Fpg/Nei enzymes. This endeavor allowed us to decipher at the atomic level the mode of action for the best TXn inhibitors on the ZnF-containing enzymes. We discovered an original inhibition mechanism for the ZnLF-containing Fpg/Nei DNA glycosylases by disulfide cyclic trimeric forms of dithiopurines. This work paves the way for the design and synthesis of a new structural class of inhibitors for selective pharmacological targeting of hNeil1 in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.',\n",
       " 'Post-translational modifications (PTM) of proteins are crucial for fine-tuning a cellâ\\x80\\x99s response to both intracellular and extracellular cues. ADP-ribosylation is a PTM, which occurs in two flavours: modification of a target with multiple ADP-ribose moieties (poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation or PARylation) or with only one unit (MARylation), which are added by the different enzymes of the PARP family (also known as the ARTD family). PARylation has been relatively well-studied, particularly in the DNA damage response. This has resulted in the development of PARP inhibitors such as olaparib, which are increasingly employed in cancer chemotherapeutic approaches. Despite the fact that the majority of PARP enzymes catalyse MARylation, MARylation is not as well understood as PARylation. MARylation is a dynamic process: the enzymes reversing intracellular MARylation of acidic amino acids (MACROD1, MACROD2, and TARG1) were discovered in 2013. Since then, however, little information has been published about their physiological function. MACROD1, MACROD2, and TARG1 have a â\\x80\\x98macrodomainâ\\x80\\x99 harbouring the catalytic site, but no other domains have been identified. Despite the lack of information regarding their cellular roles, there are a number of studies linking them to cancer. However, some of these publications oppose each other, some rely on poorly-characterised antibodies, or on aberrant localisation of overexpressed rather than native protein. In this review, we critically assess the available literature on a role for the hydrolases in cancer and find that, currently, there is limited evidence for a role for MACROD1, MACROD2, or TARG1 in tumorigenesis.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Fluid resuscitation has become the cornerstone of early septic shock management, but the optimal fluid rate is still not well studied. The goal of this investigation is to examine the relationship between fluid resuscitation rate and septic shock resolution. METHOD: We retrospectively studied adult (â\\x89¥ 18 years) patients with septic shock, defined based on sepsis III definition, from January 1, 2006, through May 31, 2018, in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of Mayo Clinic Rochester. The fluid resuscitation time was defined as the time required to infuse the initial fluid bolus of 30 ml/kg, based on the recommendations of the 2016 surviving sepsis campaign. The cohort was divided into four groups based on the average fluid rate (group 1 â\\x89¥ 0.5, group 2 0.25â\\x80\\x930.49, group 3 0.17â\\x80\\x930.24, and group 4 < 0.17 ml/kg/min). The primary outcome was the time to shock reversal. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to account for potential confounders. RESULT: A total of 1052 patients met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. The time-to-shock reversal was significantly different among the groups (P < .001). Patients in group 1 who received fluid resuscitation at a faster rate had a shorter time to shock reversal (HR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.66â\\x80\\x930.91; P = .01) when compared with group 4 with a median (IQR) time-to-shock reversal of 1.7 (1.5, 2.0) vs. 2.8 (2.6, 3.3) days, respectively. Using 0.25 ml/kg/min as cutoff, the higher fluid infusion rate was associated with a shorter time to shock reversal (HR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.06â\\x80\\x931.41; P = .004) and with decreased odds of 28-day mortality (HR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.60â\\x80\\x930.85; P < .001). CONCLUSION: In septic shock patients, initial fluid resuscitation rate of 0.25â\\x80\\x930.50 ml/kg/min (i.e., completion of the initial 30 ml/kg IV fluid resuscitation within the first 2 h), may be associated with early shock reversal and lower 28-day mortality compared with slower rates of infusion.',\n",
       " 'The dynamic interactions of cancer cells with their microenvironment consisting of stromal cells (cellular part) and extracellular matrix (ECM) components (non-cellular) is essential to stimulate the heterogeneity of cancer cell, clonal evolution and to increase the multidrug resistance ending in cancer cell progression and metastasis. The reciprocal cell-cell/ECM interaction and tumor cell hijacking of non-malignant cells force stromal cells to lose their function and acquire new phenotypes that promote development and invasion of tumor cells. Understanding the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms governing these interactions can be used as a novel strategy to indirectly disrupt cancer cell interplay and contribute to the development of efficient and safe therapeutic strategies to fight cancer. Furthermore, the tumor-derived circulating materials can also be used as cancer diagnostic tools to precisely predict and monitor the outcome of therapy.

       " 'Influenza virus infection increases the methylation of lysine 79 of histone 3 catalyzed by the Dot1L enzyme. The role of Dot1L against infections was highlighted by an increase of influenza A and vesicular stomatitis virus replication in Dot1L-inhibited cells mediated by a decreased antiviral response. Interferon-beta (IFN-Î²) reporter assays indicate that Dot1L is involved in the control of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I protein (RIG-I) signaling. Accordingly, Dot1L inhibition decreases the IFN-Î² promoter stimulation and RIG-I- mitochondria-associated viral sensor (RIG-I-MAVS) association upon viral infection. Replication of an influenza A virus lacking NS1 (delNS1), incapable of counteracting the antiviral response, is not affected by Dot1L inhibition. Consequently, RIG-I-MAVS association and nuclear factorâ\\x80\\x93ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) nuclear translocation, are not affected by the Dot1L inhibition in delNS1 infected cells. Restoration of NS1 expression in trans also reinstated Dot1L as a regulator of the RIG-I-dependent signaling in delNS1 infections. Interferon-inducible E3 ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) expression increases in influenza virus infected cells, but Dot1L inhibition reduces both the TRIM25 expression and TRIM25 protein levels. TRIM25 overexpression reverses the defective innate response mediated by Dot1L inhibition elicited upon virus infection or by overexpression of RIG-I signaling intermediates. Thus, TRIM25 is a control point of the RIG-I recognition pathway controlled by Dot1L and may have a general role in RNA viruses recognized by the RIG-I sensor.',\n",
       " 'Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of death among infectious diseases and an important health problem, having considerable implications for healthcare systems worldwide. Despite important advances in prevention through vaccines, new rapid diagnostic tests and antibiotics, CAP management still has significant drawbacks. Mortality remains very high in severely ill patients presenting with respiratory failure or shock but is also high in the elderly. Even after a CAP episode, higher risk of death remains during a long period, a risk mainly driven by inflammation and patient-related co-morbidities. CAP microbiology has been altered by new molecular diagnostic tests that have turned viruses into the most identified pathogens, notwithstanding uncertainties about the specific role of each virus in CAP pathogenesis. Pneumococcal vaccines also impacted CAP etiology and thus had changed Streptococcus pneumoniae circulating serotypes. Pathogens from specific regions should also be kept in mind when treating CAP. New antibiotics for CAP treatment were not tested in severely ill patients and focused on multidrug-resistant pathogens that are unrelated to CAP, limiting their general use and indications for intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Similarly, CAP management could be personalized through the use of adjunctive therapies that showed outcome improvements in particular patient groups. Although pneumococcal vaccination was only convincingly shown to reduce invasive pneumococcal disease, with a less significant effect in pneumococcal CAP, it remains the best therapeutic intervention to prevent bacterial CAP. Further research in CAP is needed to reduce its population impact and improve individual outcomes.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Liver transplantation is recognised as a treatment option for patients with propionic acidemia (PA) and those with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) without renal impairment. In patients with MMA and moderate-to-severe renal impairment, combined liverâ\\x80\\x93kidney transplantation is indicated. However, clinical experience of these transplantation options in patients with PA and MMA remains limited and fragmented. We undertook an overview of post-transplantation outcomes in patients with PA and MMA using the current available evidence. METHODS: A literature search identified publications on the use of transplantation in patients with PA and MMA. Publications were considered if they presented adequate demographic and outcome data from patients with PA or MMA. Publications that did not report any specific outcomes for patients or provided insufficient data were excluded. RESULTS: Seventy publications were identified of which 38 were full papers. A total of 373 patients underwent liver/kidney/combined liverâ\\x80\\x93kidney transplantation for PA or MMA. The most typical reason for transplantation was recurrent metabolic decompensation. A total of 27 post-transplant deaths were reported in patients with PA [14.0% (27/194)]. For patients with MMA, 18 post-transplant deaths were reported [11% (18/167)]. A total of 62 complications were reported in 115 patients with PA (54%) with cardiomyopathy (n = 12), hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT; n = 14) and viral infections (n = 12) being the most commonly reported. A total of 52 complications were reported in 106 patients with MMA (49%) with viral infections (n = 14) and renal failure/impairment (n = 10) being the most commonly reported. CONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation and combined liverâ\\x80\\x93kidney transplantation appears to benefit some patients with PA or MMA, respectively, but this approach does not provide complete correction of the metabolic defect and some patients remain at risk from disease-related and transplantation-related complications, including death. Thus, all treatment avenues should be exhausted before consideration of organ transplantation and the benefits of this approach must be weighed against the risk of perioperative complications on an individual basis.',\n",

Here, we examined the effect of varying DENV infection modality in rhesus macaques in order to improve the DENV nonhuman primate (NHP) challenge model. NHPs were exposed to DENV-1 via subcutaneous or intradermal inoculation of virus only, intradermal inoculation of virus and salivary gland extract, or infectious mosquito feeding. The infectious mosquito feeding group exhibited delayed onset of viremia, greater viral loads, and altered clinical and immune responses compared to other groups. After 15 months, NHPs in the subcutaneous and infectious mosquito feeding groups were re-exposed to either DENV-1 or DENV-2. Viral replication and neutralizing antibody following homologous challenge were suggestive of sterilizing immunity, whereas heterologous challenge resulted in productive, yet reduced, DENV-2 replication and boosted neutralizing antibody. These results show that a more transmission-relevant exposure modality resulted in viral replication closer to that observed in humans.',\n",

This study determined patterns of drug-resistance mutations (DRMs) among HIV-1 isolates from patients receiving first-line ART in South-eastern Nigeria. Blood samples were collected from HIV-1 infected patients accessing antiretroviral treatment centers at General Hospital Awo-Omamma, Imo state, State Hospital Asaba, Delta state and St Josephâ\\x80\\x99s Catholic Hospital Adazi, Anambra state and used for HIV-1 DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. DRMs were scored using combination of Stanford algorithm and the 2015 International Antiviral Society-USA list while drug susceptibility was predicted using Stanford algorithm. Twenty eight of the HIV-1 isolates were sequenced and identified as subtypes G (35.7%), CRF02_AG (57.1%) and unclassifiable, U(G) (7.1%). Major PI resistance-associated mutations were identified at two sites including M46L (16.7% of subtype G/U(G)) and V82L (6.3% of CRF02_AG). Minor PI resistance-associated mutations identified among subtype G/U(G) are L10V/I (8.3%) and K20I (100%) while L10V/I (50%), K20I (100%), L33F (6.3%) and N88D (6.3%) were identified among CRF02_AG.

Interpretation based on Stanford algorithm showed that Darunavir/ritonavir is the only regimen whose potency was not compromised by the circulating mutations. Identification of major and minor PI resistance mutations in this study underscores the need for drug resistance testing prior to initiation of second line antiretroviral therapy in Nigeria.',\n",
       " 'Efforts to develop effective and safe drugs for treatment of tuberculosis require preclinical evaluation in animal models. Alongside efficacy testing of novel therapies, effects on pulmonary pathology and disease progression are monitored by using histopathology images from these infected animals. To compare the severity of disease across treatment cohorts, pathologists have historically assigned a semi-quantitative histopathology score that may be subjective in terms of their training, experience, and personal bias. Manual histopathology therefore has limitations regarding reproducibility between studies and pathologists, potentially masking successful treatments.

New methods to screen heparanase inhibitors and to evaluate their mechanism of action and in vivo activity in experimental models prompted their development. New non-anticoagulant heparin derivatives endowed with anti-heparanase activity are reported.

       " 'Antibody neutralization of cytomegalovirus (CMV) entry into diverse cell types is a key consideration for development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics. CMV entry into fibroblasts differs significantly from entry into epithelial or endothelial cells: fibroblast entry is mediated by gB and gH/gL/gO, whereas both epithelial and endothelial cell entry require an additional pentameric complex (PC) comprised of gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131A. Because PC-specific antibodies in CMV-seropositive human sera do not affect fibroblast entry but potently block entry into epithelial or endothelial cells, substantially higher neutralizing potencies for CMV-positive sera are observed when assayed using epithelial cells as targets than when using fibroblasts. That certain sera exhibit similar discordances between neutralizing potencies measured using epithelial vs. endothelial cells (Gerna G. et al.J Gen Virol, 89:853â\\x80\\x93865, 2008) suggested that additional mechanistic differences may also exist between epithelial and endothelial cell entry. To further explore this issue, neutralizing potencies using epithelial and endothelial cells were simultaneously determined for eight CMV-positive human sera, CMV-hyperimmune globulin, and a panel of monoclonal or anti-peptide antibodies targeting specific epitopes in gB, gH, gH/gL, or the PC. No significant differences were observed between epithelial and endothelial neutralizing potencies of epitope-specific antibodies, CMV-hyperimmune globulin, or seven of the eight human sera. However, one human serum exhibited a six-fold higher potency for neutralizing entry into epithelial cells vs. endothelial cells. These results suggest that epitopes exist that are important for epithelial entry but are less critical, or perhaps dispensable, for endothelial cell entry. Their existence should be considered when developing monoclonal antibody therapies or subunit vaccines representing limited epitopes.',\n",

However, elimination of non-specific amplification remains a key challenge for the optimization of LAMP assays. Here, using chlamydia DNA as a clinically relevant target and high-throughput sequencing as an analytical tool, we investigate a potential mechanism of non-specific amplification. We then develop a real-time digital LAMP (dLAMP) with high-resolution melting temperature (HRM) analysis and use this single-molecule approach to analyze approximately 1.2 million amplification events. We show that single-molecule HRM provides insight into specific and non-specific amplification in LAMP that are difficult to deduce from bulk measurements. We use real-time dLAMP with HRM to evaluate differences between polymerase enzymes, the impact of assay parameters (e.g. time, rate or florescence intensity), and the effect background human DNA. By differentiating true and false positives, HRM enables determination of the optimal assay and analysis parameters that leads to the lowest limit of detection (LOD) in a digital isothermal amplification assay.',\n",

Such building blocks have only rarely been employed for the design of enzyme inhibitors. Herein, we demonstrate the combination of a peptidic recognition sequence with such electrophilic (het)arenes to generate highly active inhibitors of disease-relevant proteases. We further elucidate an unexpected mode of action for the trypanosomal protease rhodesain using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, enzyme kinetics and various types of simulations. After hydrolysis of an ester function in the recognition sequence of a weakly active prodrug inhibitor, the liberated carboxylic acid represents a highly potent inhibitor of rhodesain (K(i) = 4.0 nM). The simulations indicate that, after the cleavage of the ester, the carboxylic acid leaves the active site and re-binds to the enzyme in an orientation that allows the formation of a very stable Ï\\x80-complex between the catalytic dyad (Cys-25/His-162) of rhodesain and the electrophilic aromatic moiety. The reversible inhibition mode results because the S(N)Ar reaction, which is found in an alkaline solvent containing a low molecular weight thiol, is hindered within the enzyme due to the presence of the positively charged imidazolium ring of His-162. Comparisons between measured and calculated NMR shifts support this interpretation.',\n",
       " 'Newcastle disease virus (NDV) replication depends on the translation machinery of the host cell; therefore, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) gene family is a likely candidate for control of viral replication. We hypothesized that differential expression of host genes related to translation and innate immune response could contribute to differential resistance to NDV in inbred Fayoumi and Leghorn lines. The expression of twenty-one genes related to the interferon signaling pathway and the eIF2 family was evaluated at two- and six-days post infection (dpi) in the spleen from both lines, either challenged by NDV or nonchallenged. Higher expression of OASL in NDV challenged versus nonchallenged spleen was observed in Leghorns at 2 dpi. Lower expression of EIF2B5 was found in NDV challenged than nonchallenged Fayoumis and Leghorns at 2 dpi. At 2 dpi, NDV challenged Fayoumis had lower expression of EIF2B5 and EIF2S3 than NDV challenged Leghorns. At 6 dpi, NDV challenged Fayoumis had lower expression of EIF2S3 and EIF2B4 than NDV challenged Leghorns. The genetic line differences in expression of eIF2-related genes may contribute to their differential resistance to NDV and also to understanding the interaction between protein synthesis shut-off and virus control in chickens.',\n",
       " 'Genomics-based neoantigen discovery can be enhanced by proteomic evidence, but there remains a lack of consensus on the performance of different quality control methods for variant peptide identification in proteogenomics. We propose to use the difference between accurately predicted and observed retention times for each peptide as a metric to evaluate different quality control methods. To this end, we develop AutoRT, a deep learning algorithm with high accuracy in retention time prediction. Analysis of three cancer data sets with a total of 287 tumor samples using different quality control strategies results in substantially different numbers of identified variant peptides and putative neoantigens. Our systematic evaluation, using the proposed retention time metric, provides insights and practical guidance on the selection of quality control strategies. We implement the recommended strategy in a computational workflow named NeoFlow to support proteogenomics-based neoantigen prioritization, enabling more sensitive discovery of putative neoantigens.',\n",

In this study, we investigated the effects of extracts of Broussonetia papyrifera root bark (PRE) and its bioactive components on inflammation and insulin sensitivity. PRE inhibited TNF-Î±-induced NF-ÎºB transcriptional activity in the NF-ÎºB luciferase assay and pro-inflammatory genesâ\\x80\\x99 expression by blocking phosphorylation of IÎºB and NF-ÎºB in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which were mediated by activating AMPK. Ten-week-high fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL6 male mice treated with PRE had improved glucose intolerance and decreased inflammation in adipose tissue, as indicated by reductions in NF-ÎºB phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory genesâ\\x80\\x99 expression. Furthermore, PRE activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and reduced lipogenic genesâ\\x80\\x99 expression in both adipose tissue and liver. Finally, we identified broussoflavonol B (BF) and kazinol J (KJ) as bioactive constituents to suppress pro-inflammatory responses via activating AMPK in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Taken together, these results indicate the therapeutic potential of PRE, especially BF or KJ, in metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Cystic echinococcosis, caused by the cestode Echinococcus granulosus, is a neglected tropical disease with remarkable morbidity in humans and a problem of worldwide economic importance in livestock industry. Understanding the molecular basis of the parasite growth and development is essential for the disease diagnosis, management and control. The tetraspanin (TSP) family of proteins are transmembrane proteins with a role in many physiological processes of eukaryotic organisms. TSPs present in the tegumental surface of platyhelminths play pivotal roles in host-parasite interaction. However, little is known about the role of TSPs in growth and development in the Platyhelminthes. To understand the role of TSP1 in the growth and development of E. granulosus we investigated the effect of EgTSP1-specific long dsRNA in different in vitro stages of the parasite. METHODS: Different stages of E. granulosus, protoscoleces and strobilated worms, were cultivated In vitro in di-phasic media. Using long dsRNA and two delivery methods, i.e. electroporation and electro-soaking, EgTSP1 silencing was performed with an EgTSP1-specific dsRNA. The TSP1 expression profile was assessed as well as the biological and ultrastructural properties of the parasites. RESULTS: After three days of dsRNA treatment, EgTSP1 expression was significantly reduced in both stages of E. granulosus as compared to irrelevant/unrelated dsRNA and untreated controls. Silencing expression of EgTSP1 in different stages of E. granulosus resulted in reduced viability and body contractions, inhibition of protoscoleces evagination and distinctive tegumental changes. Ultrastructural morphology of the strobilated worms treated with EgTSP1-specific dsRNA was indicative of the microtriches impairments and vacuolated tegument compared to the control helminths. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present study suggest that EgTSP1 plays important structural roles in tegument configuration in E. granulosus. EgTSP1 is proved to be a potential target for the development of vaccines and RNAi-based drugs. [Image: see text]',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Understanding the genetic structure of natural populations provides insight into the demographic and adaptive processes that have affected those populations. Such information, particularly when integrated with geospatial data, can have translational applications for a variety of fields, including public health. Estimated effective migration surfaces (EEMS) is an approach that allows visualization of the spatial patterns in genomic data to understand population structure and migration. In this study, we developed a workflow to optimize the resolution of spatial grids used to generate EEMS migration maps and applied this optimized workflow to estimate migration of Plasmodium falciparum in Cambodia and bordering regions of Thailand and Vietnam. METHODS: The optimal density of EEMS grids was determined based on a new workflow created using density clustering to define genomic clusters and the spatial distance between genomic clusters. Topological skeletons were used to capture the spatial distribution for each genomic cluster and to determine the EEMS grid density; i.e., both genomic and spatial clustering were used to guide the optimization of EEMS grids. Model accuracy for migration estimates using the optimized workflow was tested and compared to grid resolutions selected without the optimized workflow. As a test case, the optimized workflow was applied to genomic data generated from P. falciparum sampled in Cambodia and bordering regions, and migration maps were compared to estimates of malaria endemicity, as well as geographic properties of the study area, as a means of validating observed migration patterns. RESULTS: Optimized grids displayed both high model accuracy and reduced computing time compared to grid densities selected in an unguided manner. In addition, EEMS migration maps generated for P. falciparum using the optimized grid corresponded to estimates of malaria endemicity and geographic properties of the study region that might be expected to impact malaria parasite migration, supporting the validity of the observed migration patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Optimized grids reduce spatial uncertainty in the EEMS contours that can result from user-defined parameters, such as the resolution of the spatial grid used in the model. This workflow will be useful to a broad range of EEMS users as it can be applied to analyses involving other organisms of interest and geographic areas.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are fibrous structures released from activated neutrophils. NET formation has been reported to be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, there are no reports dealing with serial changes of NET formation in tracheal aspirate of ARDS patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We report three cases of ARDS. Case 1 is a 69-year-old man with necrotizing fasciitis of the buttocks, case 2 is a 49-year-old woman with extensive burns (80% of total body surface), and case 3 is a 73-year-old woman with severe bacterial pneumonia. We found abundant expression of citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3) and the formation of NETs at the onset of ARDS in all cases. The amounts of Cit-H3 and NETs decreased with the amelioration of respiratory failure in cases 1 and 2. In case 2, the amounts of Cit-H3 and NETs increased with aggravation of infection and respiratory status. In case 3, the abundant expression of Cit-H3 and NETs persisted; the patient did not recover from ARDS and eventually died. Cit-H3 and NETs were found in tracheal aspirates even if the patients had no direct injury to the lung as in cases 1 and 2. CONCLUSIONS: In these three cases, the formation of NETs was observed in tracheal aspirate of patients with ARDS by either direct or indirect insults to the lung. The amount of NET formation changed dynamically over the clinical course of each patient.',\n",
       " 'The development of safe and effective combination antiretroviral therapies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection over the past several decades has significantly reduced HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. Additionally, antiretroviral drugs have provided an effective means of protection against HIV transmission. Despite these advances, significant limitations exist; namely, the inability to eliminate HIV reservoirs, the inability to reverse lymphoid tissues damage, and the lack of an effective vaccine for preventing HIV transmission. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of therapeutics and vaccines for eliminating HIV reservoirs and preventing HIV transmission requires robust in vivo models. Since HIV is a human-specific pathogen, that targets hematopoietic lineage cells and lymphoid tissues, in vivo animal models for HIV-host interactions require incorporation of human hematopoietic lineage cells and lymphoid tissues. In this review, we will discuss the construction of mouse models with human lymphoid tissues and/or hematopoietic lineage cells, termed, human immune system (HIS)-humanized mice. These HIS-humanized mouse models can support the development of functional human innate and adaptive immune cells, along with primary (thymus) and secondary (spleen) lymphoid tissues. We will discuss applications of HIS-humanized mouse models in evaluating the safety and efficacy of therapeutics against HIV reservoirs and associated immunopathology, and delineate the human immune response elicited by candidate HIV vaccines. In addition to focusing on how these HIS-humanized mouse models have already furthered our understanding of HIV and contributed to HIV therapeutics development, we discuss how emerging HIS-humanized rat models could address the limitations of HIS-mouse models.',\n",
       " 'Modified mRNA (modRNA) is a gene-delivery platform for transiently introducing a single gene or several genes of interest to different cell types and tissues. modRNA is considered to be a safe vector for gene transfer, as it negligibly activates the innate immune system and does not compromise the genome integrity. The use of modRNA in basic and translational science is rising, due to the clinical potential of modRNA. We are currently using modRNA to induce cardiac regeneration post-ischemic injury. Major obstacles in using modRNA for cardiac ischemic disease include the need for the direct and single administration of modRNA to the heart and the inefficient translation of modRNA due to its short half-life. Modulation of the 5â\\x80² untranslated region (5â\\x80² UTR) to enhance translation efficiency in ischemic cardiac disease has great value, as it can reduce the amount of modRNA needed per delivery and will achieve higher and longer protein production post-single delivery. Here, we identified that 5â\\x80² UTR, from the fatty acid metabolism gene carboxylesterase 1D (Ces1d), enhanced the translation of firefly luciferase (Luc) modRNA by 2-fold in the heart post-myocardial infarction (MI). Moreover, we identified, in the Ces1d, a specific RNA element (element D) that is responsible for the improvement of modRNA translation and leads to a 2.5-fold translation increment over Luc modRNA carrying artificial 5â\\x80² UTR, post-MI. Importantly, we were able to show that 5â\\x80² UTR Ces1d also enhances modRNA translation in the liver, but not in the kidney, post-ischemic injury, indicating that Ces1d 5â\\x80² UTR and element D may play a wider role in translation of protein under an ischemic condition.',\n",
       " 'Paramyxoviruses and pneumoviruses infect cells through fusion (F) protein-mediated merger of the viral envelope with target membranes. Members of these families include a range of major human and animal pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles virus (MeV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), and highly pathogenic Nipah virus (NiV). High-resolution F protein structures in both the metastable pre- and the postfusion conformation have been solved for several members of the families and a number of F-targeting entry inhibitors have progressed to advanced development or clinical testing. However, small-molecule RSV entry inhibitors have overall disappointed in clinical trials and viral resistance developed rapidly in experimental settings and patients, raising the question of whether the available structural information may provide a path to counteract viral escape through proactive inhibitor engineering. This article will summarize current mechanistic insight into F-mediated membrane fusion and examine the contribution of structural information to the development of small-molecule F inhibitors. Implications are outlined for future drug target selection and rational drug engineering strategies.',\n",
       " 'Most flaviviruses are arthropod-borne viruses, transmitted by either ticks or mosquitoes, and cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. They are endemic in many countries and have recently emerged in new regions, such as the Zika virus (ZIKV) in South-and Central America, the West Nile virus (WNV) in North America, and the Yellow fever virus (YFV) in Brazil and many African countries, highlighting the need for preparedness. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs available to treat flavivirus infections. We have previously discovered a broad-spectrum antiviral compound, benzavir-2, with potent antiviral activity against both DNA- and RNA-viruses. Our purpose was to investigate the inhibitory activity of benzavir-2 against flaviviruses. We used a ZIKV ZsGreen-expressing vector, two lineages of wild-type ZIKV, and other medically important flaviviruses. Benzavir-2 inhibited ZIKV derived reporter gene expression with an EC(50) value of 0.8 Â± 0.1 ÂµM. Furthermore, ZIKV plaque formation, progeny virus production, and viral RNA expression were strongly inhibited. In addition, 2.5 ÂµM of benzavir-2 reduced infection in vitro in three to five orders of magnitude for five other flaviviruses: WNV, YFV, the tick-borne encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and dengue virus. In conclusion, benzavir-2 was a potent inhibitor of flavivirus infection, which supported the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of benzavir-2.',\n",
       " 'Interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM1/2/3) have been reported to suppress the entry of a wide range of viruses. However, their antiviral functional residues and specific mechanisms are still unclear. Here, we firstly resolved the topology of IFITM1 on the plasma membrane where N-terminus points into the cytoplasm and C-terminus resides extracellularly. Further, KRRK basic residues of IFITM1 locating at 62â\\x80\\x9367 of the conserved intracellular loop (CIL) were found to play a key role in the restriction on the Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV). Similarly, KRRK basic residues of IFITM2/3 also contributed to suppressing ZIKV replication. Finally, IFITM1 was revealed to be capable of restricting the release of ZIKV particles from endosome to cytosol so as to impede the entry of ZIKV into host cells, which was tightly related with the inhibition of IFITM1 on the acidification of organelles. Overall, our study provided topology, antiviral functional residues and the mechanism of interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins.',\n",
       " 'Background: Berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline alkaloid which exhibits a variety of biological and therapeutic properties, and has been reported by some to block replication of the influenza virus. However, contradictory results have also been presented, and the mechanistic explanation is lacking. Methods: A panel of cell lines (Madinâ\\x80\\x93Darby canine kidney (MDCK), adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549), lung epithelial type I (LET1)) and primary human airway epithelial cells (HAE) susceptible to influenza virus infection were infected with a seasonal influenza A virus in the presence or absence of BBR. Cytotoxicity towards cell lines was measured using XTT assay. The yield of the virus was analyzed using RT-qPCR. To study the molecular mechanism of BBR, confocal microscopy and Western blot analyses of cellular fractions were applied. Results and conclusions: Our results show cell-type-dependent anti-influenza properties of BBR in vitro which suggests that the compound acts on the cell and not the virus. Importantly, BBR hampers influenza replication in primary human airway epithelium 3D cultures that mimic the natural replication site of the virus. Studies show that the influenza A virus upregulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway and hijacks this pathway for nucleolar export of the viral ribonucleoprotein. Our results suggest that BBR interferes with this process and hampers influenza A replication.',\n",

For these purposes, both scientific and pharmaceutical research have adopted ex vivo stem cell models because of their better predictive power. As matter of a fact, the advancing in isolation and in vitro expansion protocols for culturing autologous human stem cells, and the standardization of methods for generating patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells has made feasible to generate and investigate human cellular disease models with even greater speed and efficiency. Furthermore, the potential of stem cells on generating more complex systems, such as scaffold-cell models, organoids, or organ-on-a-chip, allowed to overcome the limitations of the two-dimensional culture systems as well as to better mimic tissues structures and functions. Finally, the advent of genome-editing/gene therapy technologies had a great impact on the generation of more proficient stem cell-disease models and on establishing an effective therapeutic treatment. In this review, we discuss important breakthroughs of stem cell-based models highlighting current directions, advantages, and limitations and point out the need to combine experimental biology with computational tools able to describe complex biological systems and deliver results or predictions in the context of personalized medicine.',\n",
       " 'Congenital heart disease-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (CHD-PAH) is one of the major complications in patients with CHD. A timely closure of the left-to-right shunt will generally result in the normalization of the pulmonary hemodynamics, but a few patients have severe prognosis in their early childhood. We hypothesized that wide-ranging pathological mechanism in PAH could elucidate the clinical state of severe CHD-PAH. Using electronic medical records, we retrospectively analyzed six infants with severe CHD-PAH who had treatment-resistant PH. All patients were born with congenital malformation syndrome. After starting on a pulmonary vasodilator, five of the six patients developed complications including pulmonary edema and interstitial lung disease (ILD), and four patients had alveolar hemorrhage. After steroid therapy, the clinical condition improved in four patients, but two patients died. The autopsy findings in one of the deceased patients indicated the presence of recurrent alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary venous hypertension, ILD, and PAH. Based on the clinical course of these CHD-PAH in patients and the literature, CHD-PAH can occur with pulmonary vascular obstructive disease (PVOD)/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH), ILD, and/or alveolar hemorrhage. The severity of CHD-PAH may depend on a genetic disorder, respiratory infection, and upper airway stenosis. Additionally, pulmonary vasodilators may be involved in the development of PVOD/PCH and ILD. When patients with CHD-PAH show unexpected deterioration, clinicians should consider complications associated with PVOD/PCH and/or pulmonary disease. In addition, the choice of upfront combination therapy for pediatric patients with CHD-PAH should be selected carefully.',\n",

This paper tries to present a novel and effective method to construct a covert channel over common compressed speech stream by embedding sense information into it. In our method, after analysing the characteristic features of the excitation pulse positions of the ITU-T G.723.1 and G.729A speech codec, we design a novel and effective covert communication channel by finely modulating the codes of excitation pulse positions of the above two codecs in line with the secret information to be hidden. To improve the embedding capacity of the proposed method, we also use all the odd/even characteristics of pulse code positions to conduct information hiding. To test and verify the proposed approach, experiments are conducted on several different scenarios. Experimental results show that our methods and algorithms perform a higher degree of secrecy and sound information embedding efficacy compared with exiting similar methods.',\n",

       " 'In this paper, we consider the problem of accelerating the numerical simulation of time dependent problems by time domain decomposition. The available algorithms enabling such decompositions present severe efficiency limitations and are an obstacle for the solution of large scale and high dimensional problems. Our main contribution is the improvement of the parallel efficiency of the parareal in time method. The parareal method is based on combining predictions made by a numerically inexpensive solver (with coarse physics and/or coarse resolution) with corrections coming from an expensive solver (with high-fidelity physics and high resolution). At convergence, the algorithm provides a solution that has the fine solverâ\\x80\\x99s high-fidelity physics and high resolution. In the classical version, the fine solver has a fixed high accuracy which is the major obstacle to achieve a competitive parallel efficiency. In this paper, we develop an adaptive variant that overcomes this obstacle by dynamically increasing the accuracy of the fine solver across the parareal iterations. We theoretically show that the parallel efficiency becomes very competitive in the ideal case where the cost of the coarse solver is small, thus proving that the only remaining factors impeding full scalability become the cost of the coarse solver and communication time. The developed theory has also the merit of setting a general framework to understand the success of several extensions of parareal based on iteratively improving the quality of the fine solver and re-using information from previous parareal steps. We illustrate the actual performance of the method in stiff ODEs, which are a challenging family of problems since the only mechanism for adaptivity is time and efficiency is affected by the cost of the coarse solver.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The first month is the most crucial period for child survival. Neonatal mortality continues to remain high with little improvement over the years in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia. This region shows the least progress in reducing neonatal mortality and continues to be a significant public health issue. In this study setting, the causes and predictors of neonatal death in the neonatal intensive care units are not well documented. Hence, this study aimed to determine the causes and predictors of neonatal mortality among infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units in eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based in prospective follow-up study was conducted among neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units of public hospitals of eastern Ethiopia from November 1 to December 30, 2018. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and a follow-up checklist. The main outcomes and causes of death were set by pediatricians and medical residents. EpiData 3.1 and Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 25 software were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of facility-based neonatal mortality. RESULTS: The proportion of facility-based neonatal mortality was 20% (95% CI:16.7â\\x80\\x9323.8%). The causes of death were complications of preterm birth (28.58%), birth asphyxia (22.45%), neonatal infection (18.36%), meconium aspiration syndrome (9.18%), respiratory distress syndrome (7.14%), and congenital malformation (4.08%). Low birth weight, preterm births, length of stay of the neonatal intensive care unit, low 5 min APGAR score, hyperthermia, and initiation of feeding were predictors of neonatal death among infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care units of public hospitals in eastern Ethiopia. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of facility-based neonatal deaths was unacceptably high. The main causes of death were preventable and treatable. Hence, improving the timing and quality of antenatal care is essential for early detection, anticipating high-risk newborns, and timely interventions. Furthermore, early initiation of feeding and better referral linkage to tertiary health facilities could lead to a reduction in neonatal death in this setting.',\n",

We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of methamphetamine-associated ICH (Meth-ICH) versus Non-Meth-ICH. Patients with ICH between January 2011 and December 2017 were studied. Meth-ICH and Non-Meth-ICH were defined by history of abuse and urine drug screen (UDS). The clinical features of the 2 groups were explored. Among the 677 consecutive patients, 61 (9.0%) were identified as Meth-ICH and 350 as Non-Meth ICH. Meth-ICH was more common in Hispanics (14.6%) and Whites (10.1%) as compared to Asians (1.2%). Patients with Meth-ICH were more often younger (51.2 vs. 62.2 years, p < 0.001), male (77.0% vs. 61.4.0%, p < 0.05), and smokers (44.3% vs. 13.4%, p < 0.001).

       " 'Dengue virus (DENV) infections may cause life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Suppressed protective immunity was shown in these patients. Although several hypotheses have been formulated, the mechanism of DENV-induced immunosuppression remains unclear. Previously, we found that cross-reactive antibodies against tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor 1 (death receptor 4 [DR4]) were elicited in DHF patients, and that anti-DR4 autoantibody fractions were elicited by nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) immunizations in experimental mice. In this study, we found that anti-DR4 antibodies could suppress B lymphocyte function in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with the anti-DR4 immunoglobulin (Ig) induced caspase-dependent cell death in immortalized B lymphocyte Raji cells in vitro. Anti-DR4 Igs elicited by NS1 and DR4 immunizations markedly suppressed mouse spleen transitional T2 B (IgM(+)IgD(+)), bone marrow pre-pro-B (B220(+)CD43(+)), pre-B (B220(+)CD43(â\\x88\\x92)), and mature B cell (B220(+)IgD(+)) subsets in mice. Furthermore, functional analysis revealed that the pre-elicitation of anti-NS1 and anti-DR4 Ig titers suppressed subsequently neutralizing antibody production by immunization with DENV envelop protein. Our data suggest that the elicitation of anti-DR4 titers through DENV NS1 immunization plays a suppressive role in humoral immunity in mice.',\n",

Despite public health impact, the occurrence of coinfections with other viruses is a common event. Increased T cell activation and altered inflammatory response are found during DENV coinfection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) impacting HIV-pathogenesis. Even with Antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV- treated patients had chronic immune activation and lymphocyte apoptosis. However, apoptotic mechanisms have not been investigated during coinfection with DENV. Our attention was attracted to apoptotic cell markers expressions in PBMCs from DENV and DENV/HIV coinfected patients. We found CD4/CD8 ratio inversion in most coinfected patients. CD4 T and CD8 T-cell subsets from DENV and DENV/HIV groups expressed low levels of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Furthermore, CD8 CD95 double positive cells frequency expressing low levels of Bcl-2 were significantly higher in these patients. Additionally, the density of Bcl-2 on classical monocytes (CD14(++)CD16(â\\x88\\x92)) was significantly lower during DENV infection. Upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins and anti-apoptotic proteins were found in DENV and DENV/HIV, while catalase, an antioxidant protein, was upregulated mainly in DENV/HIV coinfection. These findings provide evidence of apoptosis triggering during DENV/HIV coinfection, which may contribute to knowledge of immunological response during DENV acute infection in HIV-patients treated with ART.',\n",

Aim of the study - the antidiarrheal efficacy and safety study of high-dispersion silicon dioxide enterosorbent in tablet dosage form in patients with acute diarrhea. This was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-center study. Acute diarrhea was defined as three and more episodes of watery stool per day either during 48 hours or less before study entry in the patients having normal stool recently.

       " 'Skeletal muscle is a major organ for glucose disposal and thermogenesis. While hepatic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is well known as a key enzyme for gluconeogenesis, the role of muscle fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 2 (Fbp2) in glucose disposal and thermogenesis is unknown. Here, using Fbp2 knockout (KO) mice, we assessed the physiological role of Fbp2 in energy and glucose metabolism and thermogenesis. In vivo assessments of energy metabolism, glucose metabolism, and thermogenesis were performed by indirect calorimetry, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and cold challenge studies, respectively. Under both feeding and fasting conditions, Fbp2 KO mice showed similar phenotypes regarding energy and glucose metabolism compared to wild-type (WT) mice. However, Fbp2 KO mice were severely intolerant to cold challenge under fasting conditions. Mechanistically, the cold-induced intramuscular conversion of lactate to glycogen (glyconeogenesis) is completely abolished in the KO muscle, which leads to a lack of glycogen source for thermogenesis in Fbp2 KO mice. The cold-intolerant phenotype of KO mice disappeared after feeding, and the KO mice were equally as cold tolerant as the WT mice and survived during the cold challenge for three weeks. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Fbp2 is essential for muscle thermogenesis by replenishing the intramuscular glycogen pool through glyconeogenesis when the exogenous glucose source is limited. These data imply the physiological importance of Fbp2 in thermal homeostasis and suggest a potential novel therapy targeted to increase glycogen replenishment upon cold stress.',\n",
       " 'Outcomes of cardiac surgery are influenced by systemic inflammation. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a pivotal inflammatory mediator, plays a potential role as a prognostic biomarker in cardiovascular disease. The aim of this prospective, observational study was to investigate the relationship between serum HMGB1 concentrations and composite of morbidity endpoints in cardiac surgery. Arterial blood samples for HMGB1 measurement were collected from 250 patients after anaesthetic induction (baseline) and 1 h after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (post-CPB). The incidence of composite of morbidity endpoints (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure and prolonged ventilator care) was compared in relation to the tertile distribution of serum HMGB1 concentrations. The incidence of composite of morbidity endpoints was significantly different with respect to the tertile distribution of post-CPB HMGB1 concentrations (p = 0.005) only, and not to the baseline. Multivariable analysis revealed post-CPB HMGB1 concentration (OR, 1.072; p = 0.044), pre-operative creatinine and duration of CPB as independent risk factors of adverse outcome. Accounting for its prominent role in mediating sterile inflammation and its relation to detrimental outcome, HMGB1 measured 1 h after weaning from CPB would serve as a useful biomarker for accurate risk stratification in cardiac surgical patients and may guide tailored anti-inflammatory therapy.',\n",

       " 'Background: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) viruses are a major cause of disease and economic loss in pigs worldwide. High genetic diversity among PRRSV strains is problematic for successful disease control by vaccination. Mosaic DNA and vaccinia (VACV) vaccines were developed in order to improve protection against heterologous PRRSV strains. Methods: Piglets were primed and boosted with GP5-Mosaic DNA vaccine and recombinant GP5-Mosaic VACV (rGP5-Mosaic VACV), respectively. Pigs vaccinated with rGP5-WT (VR2332) DNA and rGP5-WT VACV, or empty vector DNA and empty VACV respectively, served as controls. Virus challenge was given to separate groups of vaccinated pigs with VR2332 or MN184C. Necropsies were performed 14 days after challenge. Results: Vaccination with the GP5-Mosaic-based vaccines resulted in cellular reactivity and higher levels of neutralizing antibodies to both VR2332 and MN184C PRRSV strains. In contrast, vaccination of animals with the GP5-WT vaccines induced responses only to VR2332. Furthermore, vaccination with the GP5-Mosaic based vaccines resulted in protection against challenge with two heterologous virus strains, as demonstrated by the significantly lower viral loads in serum, tissues, porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, and less severe lung lesions after challenge with either MN184C or VR2332, which have only 85% identity. In contrast, significant protection by the GP5-WT based vaccines was only achieved against the VR2332 strain. Conclusions: GP5-Mosaic vaccines, using a DNA-prime/VACV boost regimen, conferred protection in pigs against heterologous viruses.',\n",
       " 'Intramuscular (IM) immunization is generally considered incapable of generating a protective mucosal immune response. In the swine industry, attempts to develop a safe and protective vaccine for controlling porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) via an IM route of administration have been unsuccessful. In the present study, porcine chemokine ligand proteins CCL25, 27, and 28 were constructed and stably expressed in the mammalian expression system. IM co-administration of inactivated PEDV (iPEDV) particles with different CC chemokines and Freundâ\\x80\\x99s adjuvants resulted in recruiting CCR9+ and/or CCR10+ inflammatory cells to the injection site, thereby inducing superior systemic PEDV specific IgG, fecal IgA, and viral neutralizing antibodies in pigs. Moreover, pigs immunized with iPEDV in combination with CCL25 and CCL28 elicited substantial protection against a virulent PEDV challenge. We show that the porcine CC chemokines could be novel adjuvants for developing IM vaccines for modulating mucosal immune responses against mucosal transmissible pathogens in pigs.',\n",
       " 'In vitro neutralizing antibodies have been often correlated with protection against Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection. We have reported previously that a single inoculation of sucrose-purified modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) encoding RVFV glycoproteins (rMVAGnGc) was sufficient to induce a protective immune response in mice after a lethal RVFV challenge. Protection was related to the presence of glycoprotein specific CD8+ cells, with a low-level detection of in vitro neutralizing antibodies. In this work we extended those observations aimed to explore the role of humoral responses after MVA vaccination and to study the contribution of each glycoprotein antigen to the protective efficacy. Thus, we tested the efficacy and immune responses in BALB/c mice of recombinant MVA viruses expressing either glycoprotein Gn (rMVAGn) or Gc (rMVAGc). In the absence of serum neutralizing antibodies, our data strongly suggest that protection of vaccinated mice upon the RVFV challenge can be achieved by the activation of cellular responses mainly directed against Gc epitopes. The involvement of cellular immunity was stressed by the fact that protection of mice was strain dependent. Furthermore, our data suggest that the rMVA based single dose vaccination elicits suboptimal humoral immune responses against Gn antigen since disease in mice was exacerbated upon virus challenge in the presence of rMVAGnGc or rMVAGn immune serum. Thus, Gc-specific cellular immunity could be an important component in the protection after the challenge observed in BALB/c mice, contributing to the elimination of infected cells reducing morbidity and mortality and counteracting the deleterious effect of a subneutralizing antibody immune response.',\n",

Trapping of migratory birds during their resting periods at the northern coast of Egypt is a common and ancient practice performed mainly for selling in live bird markets (LBM). In the present study, samples were collected from 148 wild birds, representing 14 species, which were being offered for sale in LBM. All birds were tested for the presence of AIV and enterobacteriaceae. Ten samples collected from Northern Shoveler birds (Spatula clypeata) were positive for IAV and PCR sub-typing and pan HA/NA sequencing assays detected H5N8, H9N2, and H6N2 viruses in four, four, and one birds, respectively. Sequencing of the full haemagglutinin (HA) gene revealed a high similarity with currently circulating IAV in Egypt.

       " 'Live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) represent one of the most important medical innovations in human history. In the past three centuries, LAV have saved hundreds of millions of lives, and will continue to do so for many decades to come. Interestingly, the most successful LAVs, such as the smallpox vaccine, the measles vaccine, and the yellow fever vaccine, have been isolated and/or developed in a purely empirical manner without any understanding of the immunological mechanisms they trigger. Today, the mechanisms governing potent LAV immunogenicity and long-term induced protective immunity continue to be elusive, and therefore hamper the rational design of innovative vaccine strategies. A serious roadblock to understanding LAV-induced immunity has been the lack of suitable and cost-effective animal models that can accurately mimic human immune responses. In the last two decades, human-immune system mice (HIS mice), i.e., mice engrafted with components of the human immune system, have been instrumental in investigating the life-cycle and immune responses to multiple human-tropic pathogens. However, their use in LAV research has remained limited. Here, we discuss the strong potential of LAVs as tools to enhance our understanding of human immunity and review the past, current and future contributions of HIS mice to this endeavor.',\n",
       " 'The need for a malaria vaccine is indisputable. A single vaccine for Plasmodium pre-erythrocytic stages targeting the major sporozoite antigen circumsporozoite protein (CSP) has had partial success. Additionally, CD8+ T cells targeting liver-stage (LS) antigens induced by live attenuated sporozoite vaccines were associated with protection in human challenge experiments. To further evaluate protection mediated by LS antigens, we focused on exported pre-erythrocytic proteins (exported protein 1 (EXP1), profilin (PFN), exported protein 2 (EXP2), inhibitor of cysteine proteases (ICP), transmembrane protein 21 (TMP21), and upregulated in infective sporozoites-3 (UIS3)) expressed in all Plasmodium species and designed optimized, synthetic DNA (synDNA) immunogens. SynDNA antigen cocktails were tested with and without the molecular adjuvant plasmid IL-33. Immunized animals developed robust T cell responses including induction of antigen-specific liver-localized CD8+ T cells, which were enhanced by the co-delivery of plasmid IL-33. In total, 100% of mice in adjuvanted groups and 71%â\\x80\\x9388% in non-adjuvanted groups were protected from blood-stage disease following Plasmodium yoelii sporozoite challenge.

       " 'While the basic mechanisms of flavivirus entry and fusion are understood, little is known about the postfusion events that precede RNA replication, such as nucleocapsid disassembly. We describe here a sensitive, conditionally replication-defective yellow fever virus (YFV) entry reporter, YFVÎ\\x94SK/Nluc, to quantitively monitor the translation of incoming, virus particle-delivered genomes. We validated that YFVÎ\\x94SK/Nluc gene expression can be neutralized by YFV-specific antisera and requires known flavivirus entry pathways and cellular factors, including clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis, endosomal acidification, YFV E glycoprotein-mediated fusion, and cellular LY6E and RPLP1 expression. The initial round of YFV translation was shown to require cellular ubiquitylation, consistent with recent findings that dengue virus capsid protein must be ubiquitylated in order for nucleocapsid uncoating to occur. Importantly, translation of incoming YFV genomes also required valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, a cellular ATPase that unfolds and extracts ubiquitylated client proteins from large complexes. RNA transfection and washout experiments showed that VCP/p97 functions at a postfusion, pretranslation step in YFV entry. Finally, VCP/p97 activity was required by other flaviviruses in mammalian cells and by YFV in mosquito cells. Together, these data support a critical role for VCP/p97 in the disassembly of incoming flavivirus nucleocapsids during a postfusion step in virus entry.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis in Ethiopia is a re-emerging threat to public health, with increased geographical distribution and number of cases. It is a fatal disease without early diagnosis and treatment; thus, the availability of affordable diagnostic tools is crucial. However, due to delays caused by import regulations, procurement and late delivery of imported test kits, accessibility remains a problem in the control program. Therefore, we aimed to produce and evaluate the performance of an in-house liquid (AQ) direct agglutination test (DAT) antigen. RESULT: The AQ-DAT was produced at the Armauer Hansen Research Institute, using Leishmania donovani strain (MHOM/ET/67/L82). Sera from 272 participants; 110 microscopically confirmed cases of VL, 76 apparently healthy and 86 patients who had infectious disease other than VL were tested with AQ-DAT, and standard kits: Freeze-dried DAT (FD-DAT) and rK39. Taking microscopy as a gold standard; the sensitivity and specificity of the AQ-DAT were 97.3 and 98.8%, respectively. It had high degrees of agreement (k > 0.8), with a significant (P < 0.05) correlation compared to microscopy, FD-DAT, and rK39. CONCLUSION: Although further standardization is required, the in-house AQ-DAT could improve diagnostic accessibility, minimize intermittent stock outs and strengthen the national VL control program.',\n",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of an empirical therapy of high-dose versus standard-dose meropenem in sepsis and septic shock patients. METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized open-label study to compare the changes of modified sequential organ failure assessment (mSOFA) score and other clinical outcomes of the high-dose meropenem (2-g infusion over 3 h every 8 h) versus the standard-dose meropenem (1-g infusion over 3 h every 8 h) in sepsis and septic shock patients. Patientsâ\\x80\\x99 characteristics, clinical and microbiological outcomes, 14 and 28-day mortality, vasopressor- and ventilator-free days, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital-free days, percent of the time of antibiotic concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (%T>MIC), and safety were assessed. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients were enrolled. Median delta mSOFA was comparable between two groups (â\\x80\\x93 1 in the high-dose group vs. â\\x80\\x93 1 in the standard-dose group; P value = 0.75). There was no difference between the two groups regarding clinical and microbiological cure, 14- and 28-day mortality, vasopressor- and ventilator-free days, and ICU- and hospital-free days. In patients admitted from the emergency department (ED) with a mSOFA score â\\x89¥ 7, the high-dose group demonstrated significantly better microbiological cure compared with the standard-dose group (75% (9/12 patients) vs. 20% (2/10 patients); P value = 0.03). Likewise, the high-dose group presented higher microbiological cure rate in patients admitted from ED who had either APACHE II score > 20 (83.3% (10/12) vs. 28.6% (2/7); P value = 0.045) or on mechanical ventilator (87.5% (7/8) vs. 23.1% (3/13); P value = 0.008) than the standard-dose group. Adverse events were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical therapy with the high-dose meropenem presented comparable clinical outcomes to the standard-dose meropenem in sepsis and septic shock patients. Besides, subgroup analysis manifested superior microbiological cure rate in sepsis or septic shock patients admitted from ED.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated spinal cord autoregulation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Here, we assessed spinal cord autoregulation under normal, hypovolemic, and post-fluid resuscitation conditions compared with cerebral autoregulation. METHODS: Ten pigs (36.1 Â± 1.1 kg) were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane, before phenylephrine administration at 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 Î¼g kg(â\\x88\\x921) min(â\\x88\\x921) in a stepwise fashion at 10-min intervals (baseline), followed by similar administration of sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Hypovolemia was induced by a 600-ml bleed (25% estimated total blood volume). Only phenylephrine was readministered (same protocol). Hypovolemia was reversed by infusing 600 ml hydroxyethyl starch, before readministering phenylephrine and SNP. The relationships between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord tissue oxygenation indices (TOIs) were evaluated. RESULTS: Thoracic and lumbar spinal cord TOIs were approximately 15% and 10% lower, respectively, than the cerebral TOI at similar MAPs. The average relationship between MAP and each TOI showed an autoregulatory pattern, but negative correlations were observed in the cerebral TOI during phenylephrine infusion. A 600-ml bleed lowered each relationship < 5% and subsequent fluid resuscitation did not change the relationship. Individual oxygenation responses to blood pressure indicated that the spinal cord is more pressure-passive than the cerebrum. Paradoxical responses (an inverse relationship of tissue oxygenation to MAP) were observed particularly in cerebrum during phenylephrine infusion and were rare in the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal cord autoregulation is less robust than cerebral autoregulation and more pressure-dependent. Similar to cerebral oxygenation, spinal cord oxygenation is volume-tolerant but is more sensitive to hypotension.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The emergence of Zika virus (ZV) in tropical and subtropical areas of the world has created an urgent need for vaccines against ZV. However, approved vaccines that prevent ZV infection are not available. To develop an effective vaccine against ZV infection, a lipidated form of ZV envelope protein domain III that possesses an intrinsic adjuvant property was rationally designed. Our goal was to examine the immunogenicity of recombinant lipidated ZV envelope protein domain III (rLZE3) and evaluate its potential as a vaccine candidate against ZV. METHODS: Recombinant ZV envelope protein domain III (rZE3) and rLZE3 were prepared with an Escherichia coli-based system. Dendritic cell surface marker expression and cytokine production upon stimulation were analyzed to evaluate the function of rLZE3. Neutralizing antibody capacities were evaluated using focus reduction neutralization tests after immunization. To investigate the protective immunity in immunized mice, serum samples collected from immunized mice were adoptively transferred into AG129 mice, and then viremia levels and survival times were examined after ZV challenge. RESULTS: rLZE3 alone but not rZE3 alone efficiently activated dendritic cells in vitro and was taken up by dendritic cells in vivo. Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with rLZE3 alone (without exogenous adjuvant) could induce ZV-specific neutralizing antibody responses. Furthermore, serum samples obtained from rLZE3-immunized mice provided protection as indicated by a reduction in viremia levels and prolongation of survival times after ZV challenge. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that rLZE3 is an excellent vaccine candidate and has great potential that should be evaluated in further preclinical studies.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Since the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic, Public Health England have developed a suite of real-time statistical models utilising enhanced pandemic surveillance data to nowcast and forecast a future pandemic. Their ability to track seasonal influenza and predict heightened winter healthcare burden in the light of high activity in Australia in 2017 was untested. METHODS: Four transmission models were used in forecasting the 2017/2018 seasonal influenza epidemic in England: a stratified primary care model using daily, region-specific, counts and virological swab positivity of influenza-like illness consultations in general practice (GP); a strain-specific (SS) model using weekly, national GP ILI and virological data; an intensive care model (ICU) using reports of ICU influenza admissions; and a synthesis model that included all data sources. For the first 12 weeks of 2018, each model was applied to the latest data to provide estimates of epidemic parameters and short-term influenza forecasts. The added value of pre-season population susceptibility data was explored. RESULTS: The combined results provided valuable nowcasts of the state of the epidemic. Short-term predictions of burden on primary and secondary health services were initially highly variable before reaching consensus beyond the observed peaks in activity between weeks 3â\\x80\\x934 of 2018. Estimates for R(0) were consistent over time for three of the four models until week 12 of 2018, and there was consistency in the estimation of R(0) across the SPC and SS models, and in the ICU attack rates estimated by the ICU and the synthesis model. Estimation and predictions varied according to the assumed levels of pre-season immunity. CONCLUSIONS: This exercise successfully applied a range of pandemic models to seasonal influenza. Forecasting early in the season remains challenging but represents a crucially important activity to inform planning. Improved knowledge of pre-existing levels of immunity would be valuable.',\n",

       " 'CpG dinucleotides are suppressed in the genomes of many vertebrate RNA viruses, including HIV-1. The cellular antiviral protein ZAP (zinc finger antiviral protein) binds CpGs and inhibits HIV-1 replication when CpGs are introduced into the viral genome. However, it is not known if ZAP-mediated restriction is the only mechanism driving CpG suppression. To determine how CpG dinucleotides affect HIV-1 replication, we increased their abundance in multiple regions of the viral genome and analyzed the effect on RNA expression, protein abundance, and infectious-virus production. We found that the antiviral effect of CpGs was not correlated with their abundance. Interestingly, CpGs inserted into some regions of the genome sensitize the virus to ZAP antiviral activity more efficiently than insertions into other regions, and this sensitivity can be modulated by interferon treatment or ZAP overexpression. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the virus to endogenous ZAP was correlated with its sensitivity to the ZAP cofactor KHNYN. Finally, we show that CpGs in some contexts can also inhibit HIV-1 replication by ZAP-independent mechanisms, and one of these is the activation of a cryptic splice site at the expense of a canonical splice site. Overall, we show that the location and sequence context of the CpG in the viral genome determines its antiviral activity. IMPORTANCE Some RNA virus genomes are suppressed in the nucleotide combination of a cytosine followed by a guanosine (CpG), indicating that they are detrimental to the virus. The antiviral protein ZAP binds viral RNA containing CpGs and prevents the virus from multiplying. However, it remains unknown how the number and position of CpGs in viral genomes affect restriction by ZAP and whether CpGs have other antiviral mechanisms. Importantly, manipulating the CpG content in viral genomes could help create new vaccines. HIV-1 shows marked CpG suppression, and by introducing CpGs into its genome, we show that ZAP efficiently targets a specific region of the viral genome, that the number of CpGs does not predict the magnitude of antiviral activity, and that CpGs can inhibit HIV-1 gene expression through a ZAP-independent mechanism. Overall, the position of CpGs in the HIV-1 genome determines the magnitude and mechanism through which they inhibit the virus.',\n",

       " 'DNA vaccines expressing codon-optimized Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein genes provide protective immunity to mice and nonhuman primates when delivered by intramuscular (IM) electroporation (EP). To achieve equivalent protective efficacy in the absence of EP, we evaluated VEEV and EBOV DNA vaccines constructed using minimalized Nanoplasmid expression vectors that are smaller than conventional plasmids used for DNA vaccination. These vectors may also be designed to co-express type I interferon inducing innate immune agonist genes that have an adjuvant effect. Nanoplasmid vaccinated mice had increased antibody responses as compared to those receiving our conventional pWRG7077-based vaccines when delivered by IM injection, and these responses were further enhanced by the inclusion of the innate immune agonist genes. The Nanoplasmid VEEV DNA vaccines also significantly increased protection against aerosol VEEV challenge as compared to the pWRG7077 VEEV DNA vaccine. Although all mice receiving the pWRG7077 and Nanoplasmid EBOV DNA vaccines at the dose tested survived EBOV challenge, only mice receiving the Nanoplasmid EBOV DNA vaccine that co-expresses the innate immune agonist genes failed to lose weight after challenge. Our results suggest that Nanoplasmid vectors can improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of alphavirus and filovirus DNA vaccines.',\n",

However, the tolerance of human genomes to losing enhancers has not yet been evaluated. Here we present the catalog of LoF-tolerant enhancers using structural variants from whole-genome sequences. Using a conservative approach, we estimate that individual human genomes possess at least 28 LoF-tolerant enhancers on average. We assessed the properties of LoF-tolerant enhancers in a unified regulatory network constructed by integrating tissue-specific enhancers and gene-gene interactions. We find that LoF-tolerant enhancers tend to be more tissue-specific and regulate fewer and more dispensable genes relative to other enhancers. They are enriched in immune-related cells while enhancers with low LoF-tolerance are enriched in kidney and brain/neuronal stem cells. We developed a supervised learning approach to predict the LoF-tolerance of all enhancers, which achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 98%. We predict 3,519 more enhancers would be likely tolerant to LoF and 129 enhancers that would have low LoF-tolerance. Our predictions are supported by a known set of disease enhancers and novel deletions from PacBio sequencing. The LoF-tolerance scores provided here will serve as an important reference for disease studies.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Loss of vascular tone is a key pathophysiological feature of septic shock. Combination of gradual diastolic hypotension and tachycardia could reflect more serious vasodilatory conditions. We sought to evaluate the relationships between heart rate (HR) to diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) ratios and clinical outcomes during early phases of septic shock. METHODS: Diastolic shock index (DSI) was defined as the ratio between HR and DAP. DSI calculated just before starting vasopressors (Pre-VPs/DSI) in a preliminary cohort of 337 patients with septic shock (January 2015 to February 2017) and at vasopressor start (VPs/DSI) in 424 patients with septic shock included in a recent randomized controlled trial (ANDROMEDA-SHOCK; March 2017 to April 2018) was partitioned into five quantiles to estimate the relative risks (RR) of death with respect to the mean risk of each population (assumed to be 1). Matched HR and DAP subsamples were created to evaluate the effect of the individual components of the DSI on RRs. In addition, time-course of DSI and interaction between DSI and vasopressor dose (DSI*NE.dose) were compared between survivors and non-survivors from both populations, while ROC curves were used to identify variables predicting mortality. Finally, as exploratory observation, effect of early start of vasopressors was evaluated at each Pre-VPs/DSI quintile from the preliminary cohort. RESULTS: Risk of death progressively increased at gradual increments of Pre-VPs/DSI or VPs/DSI (One-way ANOVA, p < 0.001). Progressive DAP decrease or HR increase was associated with higher mortality risks only when DSI concomitantly increased. Areas under the ROC curve for Pre-VPs/DSI, SOFA and initial lactate were similar, while mean arterial pressure and systolic shock index showed poor performances to predict mortality. Time-course of DSI and DSI*NE.dose was significantly higher in non-survivors from both populations (repeated-measures ANOVA, p < 0.001). Very early start of vasopressors exhibited an apparent benefit at higher Pre-VPs/DSI quintile. CONCLUSIONS: DSI at pre-vasopressor and vasopressor start points might represent a very early identifier of patients at high risk of death. Isolated DAP or HR values do not clearly identify such risk.

       " 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver injury, but it is unclear whether the inflammasome is involved and is the objective of this study. METHODS: Gene expression was analyzed in the livers of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (n = 15) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (n = 15). Bile duct ligation (BDL) or sham operation was performed in wild-type (WT) and Caspase-1(â\\x80\\x93/â\\x80\\x93) (Casp1(â\\x80\\x93/â\\x80\\x93)) mice for 7 days. Mouse hepatocytes and macrophages were treated with bile acids. RESULTS: Caspase-1, NLRP1, NLRP3 and IL-1Î² were significantly increased in the livers of cholestatic patients when compared to healthy control subjects (n = 9). Significantly higher levels of plasma IL-1Î² (826 vs 345 pg/ml), ALT (674 vs 482 U/L) and ALP (900 vs 622 U/L) were seen in WT BDL mice compared to Casp1(â\\x80\\x93/â\\x80\\x93) BDL mice. Caspase-1 cleavage was found only in WT BDL livers. Assessment of liver histology indicated more fibrosis in Casp1(â\\x80\\x93/â\\x80\\x93) BDL mice than in WT BDL mice, confirmed by analyses of liver hydroxyproline content and the expression of fibrotic genes. Profiling of immune cells revealed that there were more macrophages in Casp1(â\\x80\\x93/â\\x80\\x93) BDL livers than in WT BDL livers. Further macrophage phenotype characterization indicated that Casp1(â\\x80\\x93/â\\x80\\x93) BDL livers had more M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages evidenced by more CD206 positive cells and higher expression of IL-4, CD163, Fizz1 and IL-33. When mouse hepatocytes and peritoneal macrophages were exposed to cholestatic levels of major endogenous bile acids (300Î¼M TCA), neither IL-1Î² induction nor procaspase-1 cleavage were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The inflammasome exacerbates cholestatic liver injury, but bile acids do not directly activate the inflammasome.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by dimorphic Leishmania species is a parasitic disease with high socioeconomic burden in endemic areas worldwide. Sustaining control of VL in terms of proper and prevailing immunity development is a global necessity amid unavailability of a prophylactic vaccine. Screening of experimental proteome of the human disease propagating form of Leishmania donovani (amastigote) can be more pragmatic for in silico mining of novel vaccine candidates. METHODS: By using an immunoinformatic approach, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-specific epitopes from experimentally reported L. donovani proteins having secretory potential and increased abundance in amastigotes were screened. A chimera linked with a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) peptide adjuvant was constructed and evaluated for physicochemical characteristics, binding interaction with TLR4 in simulated physiological condition and the trend of immune response following hypothetical immunization. RESULTS: Selected epitopes from physiologically important L. donovani proteins were found mostly conserved in L. infantum, covering theoretically more than 98% of the global population. The multi-epitope chimeric vaccine was predicted as stable, antigenic and non-allergenic. Structural analysis of vaccine-TLR4 receptor docked complex and its molecular dynamics simulation suggest sufficiently stable binding interface along with prospect of non-canonical receptor activation. Simulation dynamics of immune response following hypothetical immunization indicate active and memory B as well as CD4+ T cell generation potential, and likely chance of a more Th1 polarized response. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological approach and results from this study could facilitate more informed screening and selection of candidate antigenic proteins for entry into vaccine production pipeline in future to control human VL.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children experience some of the highest rates of otitis media in the world. Key risk factors for otitis media in Aboriginal children in Australia are largely social and environmental factors such as overcrowded housing, poverty and limited access to services. Despite this, little is known about how to address these risk factors. A scoping content review was performed to determine the relationship between social determinants of health and otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children as described by peer-reviewed and grey literature. METHOD: Search terms were established for location, population and health condition. The search terms were used to conduct a literature search using six health research databases. Following the exclusion process, articles were scoped, analysed and categorised using scoping parameters and a social determinants of health framework. RESULTS: Housing-related issues were the most frequently reported determinants for otitis media (56%). Two articles (4%) directly investigated the impact of social determinants of health on rates of otitis media within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The majority of the literature (68%) highlights social determinants as playing a key role in the high rates of otitis media seen in Aboriginal populations in Australia. There were no intervention studies targeting social determinants as a means to reduce otitis media rates among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. CONCLUSIONS: This review identifies a disconnect between otitis media drivers and the focus of public health interventions within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. Despite consensus that social determinants play a key role in the high rates of otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, the majority of intervention studies within the literature are focussed on biomedical approaches such as research on vaccines and antibiotics. This review highlights the need for otitis media intervention studies to shift away from a purely biomedical model and toward investigating the underlying social determinants of health. By shifting interventions upstream, otitis media rates may decrease within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, as focus is shifted away from a treatment-focussed model and toward a more preventative model.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is a protozoan that develops in red blood cells (RBCs) and requires various host factors. For its development in RBCs, nutrients not only from the RBC cytosol but also from the extracellular milieu must be acquired. Although the utilization of host nutrients by P. falciparum has been extensively analysed, only a few studies have reported its utilization of host serum proteins. Hence, the aim of the current study was to comprehensively identify host serum proteins taken up by P. falciparum parasites and to elucidate their role in pathogenesis. METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum was cultured with human serum in vitro. Uptake of serum proteins by parasites was comprehensively determined via shotgun liquid chromatographyâ\\x80\\x93mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry and western blotting. The calcium ion concentration in serum was also evaluated, and coagulation activity of the parasite lysate was assessed. RESULTS: Three proteins, vitamin K-dependent protein S, prothrombin, and vitronectin, were selectively internalized under sufficient Ca(2+) levels in the culture medium. The uptake of these proteins was initiated before DNA replication, and increased during the trophozoite and schizont stages, irrespective of the assembly/disassembly of actin filaments. Coagulation assay revealed that prothrombin was activated and thereby induced blood coagulation. CONCLUSIONS: Serum proteins were taken up by parasites under culture conditions with sufficient Ca(2+) levels. This uptake phenomenon was associated with their pathogenicity.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The 13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV-13) was introduced in the National Immunization Programme (NIP) schedule in Russia in March 2014. Previously, the 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV-7) was marketed in Russia in 2009 but has never been offered for mass vaccination. A carriage study was performed among children in Arkhangelsk in 2006. The objective was to determine the prevalence of carriage, serotype distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility and the molecular structure of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains before marketing and introduction of PCV-13. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a cluster-randomized sample of children and a self-administrated questionnaire for parents/guardians. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from 438 children younger than 7 years attending nurseries and kindergartens in the Arkhangelsk region, Russia. Detailed demographic data, as well as information about the childâ\\x80\\x99s health, traveling, exposure to antimicrobials within the last 3 months and anthropometric measurements were collected for all study subjects. Variables extracted from the questionnaire were analysed using statistic regression models to estimate the risk of carriage. All pneumococcal isolates were examined with susceptibility testing, serotyping and multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of asymptomatic carriage was high and peaking at 36 months with a rate of 57%. PCV-13 covered 67.3% of the detected strains. High rates of non-susceptibility to penicillin, macrolides and multidrug resistance were associated with specific vaccine serotypes, pandemic clones, and local sequence types. Nine percent of isolates represented three globally disseminated disease-associated pandemic clones; penicillin- and macrolide-resistant clones Norway(NT)-42 and Poland(6B)-20, as well as penicillin- and macrolide-susceptible clone Netherlands(3)-31. A high level of antimicrobial consumption was noted by the study. According to the parentâ\\x80\\x99s reports, 89.5% of the children used at least one antimicrobial regime since birth. None of the hypothesised predictors of S. pneumoniae carriage were statistically significant in univariable and multivariable logistic models. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified a high coverage of the PCV-13-vaccine, but serotype replacement and expansion of globally disseminated disease-associated clones with non-vaccine serotypes may be expected. Further surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and serotype distribution is therefore required.',\n",
       " 'Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is one of the causative pathogens of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which may cause severe neurological and cardiopulmonary complications in children. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, management strategy, and clinical outcomes of cardiopulmonary failure (CPF) in patients with EV-A71 infection. The pathogenesis of CPF involves both catecholamine-related cardiotoxicity following brainstem encephalitis and vasodilatory shock due to cytokine storm. Sympathetic hyperactivity, including tachycardia and hypertension, are the early clinical manifestations of cardiopulmonary involvement, which may progress to pulmonary edema/hemorrhage and/or CPF. The management strategy comprises multidisciplinary supportive treatment, including fluid management, positive pressure ventilation support, and use of milrinone, vasopressors, and inotropes. Some patients may require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Major neurological sequelae are almost inevitable once a child develops life-threatening illness. Long-term care of these children is an important medico-social issue.',\n",

This study, for the first time, estimated the gross disbursement of Japanâ\\x80\\x99s DAH from 2012 to 2016 and clarified its flows, including source, aid type, channel, target region, and target health focus area. METHODS: Data on Japan Tracker, the first data platform of Japanâ\\x80\\x99s DAH, were used. The DAH definition was based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmentâ\\x80\\x99s (OECD) sector classification. Regarding core funding to non-health-specific multilateral agencies, we estimated DAH and its flows based on the OECD methodology for calculating imputed multilateral official development assistance (ODA). RESULTS: Japanâ\\x80\\x99s DAH was estimated at 1472.94 (2012), 823.15 (2013), 832.06 (2014), 701.98 (2015), and 894.57 million USD (2016) in constant prices of 2016. Multilateral agencies received the largest DAH share of 44.96â\\x80\\x9357.01% in these periods, followed by bilateral grants (34.59â\\x80\\x9353.08%) and bilateral loans (1.96â\\x80\\x9315.04%). Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) was the largest contributors to the DAH (76.26â\\x80\\x9382.68%), followed by Ministry of Finance (MOF) (10.86â\\x80\\x9316.25%). Japanâ\\x80\\x99s DAH was most heavily distributed in the African region with 41.64â\\x80\\x9353.48% share. The channel through which the most DAH went was Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (20.04â\\x80\\x9334.89%). Between 2012 and 2016, approximately 70% was allocated to primary health care and the rest to health system strengthening. CONCLUSIONS: With many major high-level health related meetings ahead, coming years will play a powerful opportunity to reevaluate DAH and shape the future of DAH for Japan. We hope that the results of this study will enhance the social debate for and contribute to the implementation of Japanâ\\x80\\x99s DAH with a more efficient and effective strategy.',\n",

       " 'Achieving accurate, real-time estimates of disease activity is challenged by delays in case reporting. â\\x80\\x9cNowcastâ\\x80\\x9d approaches attempt to estimate the complete case counts for a given reporting date, using a time series of case reports that is known to be incomplete due to reporting delays. Modeling the reporting delay distribution is a common feature of nowcast approaches. However, many nowcast approaches ignore a crucial feature of infectious disease transmissionâ\\x80\\x94that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported casesâ\\x80\\x94and are optimized to one or two applications, which may limit generalizability. Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings. We test NobBS on dengue in Puerto Rico and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States to examine performance and robustness across settings exhibiting a range of common reporting delay characteristics (from stable to time-varying), and compare this approach with a published nowcasting software package while investigating the features of each approach that contribute to good or poor performance. We show that introducing a temporal relationship between cases considerably improves performance when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying, and we identify trade-offs in the role of moving windows to accurately capture changes in the delay. We present software implementing this new approach (R package â\\x80\\x9cNobBSâ\\x80\\x9d) for widespread application and provide practical guidance on implementation.',\n",

Owing to the different incidences in males and females, this study aims to analyze the features involved in the transmission of shigellosis among male (subscript m) and female (subscript f) individuals using a newly developed sex-based model. METHODS: The data of reported shigellosis cases were collected from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention in Hubei Province from 2005 to 2017. A sex-based Susceptibleâ\\x80\\x93Exposedâ\\x80\\x93Infectious/Asymptomaticâ\\x80\\x93Recovered (SEIAR) model was applied to explore the dataset, and a sex-age-based SEIAR model was applied in 2010 to explore the sex- and age-specific transmissions. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2017, 130 770 shigellosis cases (including 73 981 male and 56 789 female cases) were reported in Hubei Province. The SEIAR model exhibited a significant fitting effect with the shigellosis data (P < 0.001). The median values of the shigellosis transmission were 2.3225 Ã\\x97 10(8) for SAR(mm) (secondary attack rate from male to male), 2.5729 Ã\\x97 10(8) for SAR(mf), 2.7630 Ã\\x97 10(-8) for SAR(fm), and 2.1061 Ã\\x97 10(-8) for SAR(ff). The top five mean values of the transmission relative rate in 2010 (where the subscript 1 was defined as male and age â\\x89¤ 5 years, 2 was male and age 6 to 59 years, 3 was male and age â\\x89¥ 60 years, 4 was female and age â\\x89¤ 5 years, 5 was female and age 6 to 59 years, and 6 was male and age â\\x89¥ 60 years) were 5.76 Ã\\x97 10(-8) for Î²(61), 5.32 Ã\\x97 10(-8) for Î²(31), 4.01 Ã\\x97 10(-8) for Î²(34), 7.52 Ã\\x97 10(-9) for Î²(62), and 6.04 Ã\\x97 10(-9) for Î²(64). CONCLUSIONS: The transmissibility of shigellosis differed among male and female individuals. The transmissibility between the genders was higher than that within the genders, particularly female-to-male transmission. The most important route in children (age â\\x89¤ 5 years) was transmission from the elderly (age â\\x89¥ 60 years).

       " 'Effective analysis of pathogens causing human and veterinary diseases demands rapid, specific and sensitive detection methods which can be applied in research laboratory setups and in field for routine diagnosis. Paper lateral flow biosensors (LFBs) have been established as attractive tools for such analytical applications. In the present study a prototype LFB was designed for whole particles (virions) detection of nodavirus or fish nervous necrosis virus. Nodavirus is an important threat in the aquaculture industry, causing severe economic losses and environmental problems. The LFB was based on polyclonal antibodies conjugated on gold nanoparticles for signal visualization. Brain and retinas from fish samples were homogenized, centrifuged and the supernatant was directly applied on the LFB. Formation of a red test line was indicative of nodavirus virions presence. Nodavirus visual detection was completed in short time (30 min). Key factors of the LFB development influencing the assaysâ\\x80\\x99 detection limit were characterized and the optimum parameters were determined, enabling increased efficiency, excluding non-specific interactions. Therefore, the proposed LFB assay consists a robust, simple, low cost and accurate method for detection of nodavirus virions in fish samples. The proposed biosensor is ideal for development of a commercial kit to be used on aquaculture facilities by fish farmers. It is anticipated that disease monitoring and environmental safety will benefit from the simplification of time consuming and costly procedures.',\n",

Increased virulence in HP isolates derives from harboring the cag (cytotoxin-associated genes) pathogenicity island (cagPAI). We analyzed the microvariants in cagPAI genes with the hypothesis that they may play an important role in determining HP virulence. We tested DNAs from cagA positive patients HP isolates; a total of 74 patients with chronic gastritis (CG, N = 37), intestinal metaplasia (IM, N = 21) or gastric cancer (GC, N = 16) from Mexico and Colombia. We selected 520 non-synonymous variants with at least 7.5% frequency in the original sequence outputs or with a minimum of 5 isolates with minor allele. After adjustment for multiple comparisons, no variants were statistically significantly associated with IM or GC. However, 19 non-synonymous showed conventional P-values < 0.05 comparing the frequency of the alleles between the isolates from subjects with gastritis and isolates from subjects with IM or GC; 12 of these showed a significant correlation with the severity of the disease. The present study revealed that several cagPAI genes from Latin American Western HP strains contains a number of non-synonymous variants in relatively high frequencies which could influence on the clinical outcome. However, none of the associations remained statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparison.',\n",

       " 'Coastal zones are characterized by the interactions between continents and oceans and, therefore, between fresh and salt surface and groundwater. The wetlands of coastal zones represent transitional ecosystems that are affected by these conditions, although little is known about the hydrogeochemistry of wetlands, especially coastal wetlands. In the present study, the hydrogeochemical characterization of coastal freshwater herbaceous wetlands in the CiÃ©naga del Fuerte Protected Natural Area in Veracruz, Mexico, in the American tropics was carried out per plant community. Four herbaceous wetlands (alligator flag, saw grass, cattail, and floodplain pasture) were monitored to understand the origin of the water feeding these ecosystems, the hydrogeochemical composition of groundwater, and the relationship between the groundwater and ecology of these ecosystems during dry and rainy seasons. The results indicate that CiÃ©naga del Fuerte is located in a regional discharge area and receives local recharge, so it is fed by both regional and local flows. The chemical composition varied temporally and spatially, creating unique conditions that determined the habitat occupied by the hydrophytic vegetation. The spatiotemporal behaviour of groundwater is one factor that, along with the hydroperiod, determines wetland dynamics and affects wetland biota (ecohydrogeochemistry). Generalist plant communities established in zones of local recharge, whereas other more specialized and/or plastic communities inhabited zones receiving regional flows with greater ion concentrations. This information forms the basis for establishing an appropriate scale (municipal, state, or larger regions) for the sustainable management of goods and services provided by the wetlands.',\n",

However, the use of such data as an alarm signal is rarely considered consciously when planning programmes. The present study aims to investigate the spatial distribution pattern of the infestation of Aedes aegypti, considering the data available in the Ae. aegypti Infestation Index Rapid Survey (LIRAa) for the city of Campina Grande, ParaÃ\\xadba State in Brazil. METHODS: The global and local MoranÊ¼s indices were used in spatial analysis to measure the effects of spatial dependencies between neighbourhoods, using secondary data related to HI and BI gathered from surveillance service. RESULTS: Our analysis shows that there is a predominance of high rates of mosquito infestation, placing Campina Grande at a near-constant risk of arbovirus outbreaks and epidemics. A highly significant MoranÊ¼s index value (P < 0.001) was observed, indicating a positive spatial dependency between the neighbourhoods in Campina Grande. Using the Moran mapping and LISA mapping, the autocorrelation patterns of Ae. aegypti infestation rates among neighbourhoods have revealed hotpots that should be considered a priority to preventive actions of the entomological surveillance services. Predominance of high infestation rates and clearer relationships of these between neighbourhoods were observed between the months of May and July, the period with the highest rainfall in the city. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis is an innovative strategy capable of providing detailed information on infestation locations to the relevant public health authorities, which will enable a more efficient allocation of resources, particularly for arbovirus prevention.

Polylactic acid (PLA) for 3D printing is widely available and biocompatible, but there is a gap in knowledge concerning its compatibility with chemical disinfectants. In this study, 3D-printed PLA tensile samples were created with six different printer settings. Each of these six batches consisted of five sets with five or six samples. The first set remained untreated, the others were soaked in Cidex OPA or in a chlorine solution. These were applied for seven consecutive days or in 25 short cycles. All samples were weighed before and after treatment and subjected to a tensile test. Results showed that a third of the treatments led to an increase of the median weight with a maximum of 8.3%, however, the samples with the best surface quality did not change. The median strength increase was 12.5% and the largest decrease was 8.8%. The median stiffness decreased 3.6% in one set and increased in three others up to 13.6%. When 3D printing PLA medical tools, surface porosity must be minimized to prevent transfer of disinfectants to people. The wide variability of mechanical properties due to 3D printing itself and as a consequence of disinfection must be considered when designing medical tools by selecting appropriate printer settings. If these conditions are met, reusing 3D-printed PLA medical tools seems safe from a mechanical point of view.',\n",

The paper then attempts to review how a proposed system can manage to operate successfully within the context of the nine named hindrance factors. The primary focus of the paper is in the description of a system which can increase the availability of diagnostics through technology-enabled systems. Such a system would impact the outcomes of persons in underserved regions.

The survey was endorsed by ESICM. RESULTS: There were 687 respondents [472 (69%) from Europe], mainly intensivists [328 (48%)] and anesthesiologists [206 (30%)]. A standard protocol for mechanical ventilation in TBI patients was utilized by 277 (40%) respondents and a specific weaning protocol by 198 (30%). The most common tidal volume (TV) applied was 6â\\x80\\x938 ml/kg of predicted body weight (PBW) in scenarios 1â\\x80\\x932 (72% PaO(2)/FIO(2) > 300 and 61% PaO(2)/FiO(2) 150â\\x80\\x93300) and 4â\\x80\\x936 ml/kg/PBW in scenario 3 (53% PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 150).

       " 'BACKGROUND: Profiling immune responses induced by either infection or vaccination can provide insight into identification of correlates of protection. Furthermore, profiling of serological responses can be used to identify biomarkers indicative of exposure to pathogens. Conducting such immune surveillance requires readout methods that are high-throughput, robust, and require small sample volumes. While the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the classical readout method for assessing serological responses, the advent of multiplex assays has significantly increased the throughput and capacity for immunoprofiling. This report describes the development and assay performance (sensitivity, linearity of detection, requirement for multiple dilutions for each sample, intra- and inter-assay variability) of an electro-chemiluminescence (ECLIA)-based multiplex assay. METHODS: The current study describes the development of a multiplex ECLIA-based assay and characterizes the sensitivity, linear range, and inter- and intra-assay variability of the ECLIA platform and its agreement with the traditional ELISA. Special emphasis was placed on potential antigenic competition when testing closely related antigens in the multiplex format. RESULTS: Multiplexing of antigens in ECLIA provides significant practical benefits in terms of reducing sample volume requirements and experimental time. Beyond the practical advantages of multiplexing, the ECLIA provides superior assay performance when compared to the ELISA. Not only does ECLIA show good agreement with the ELISA assay, but the linear range of ECLIA is also sufficiently wide to permit single-dilution measurements of concentration without the need to do serial dilutions. The lack of antigenic competition allows the simultaneous testing of closely related antigens, such as plate antigens representing different alleles of the same protein, which can inform about cross-reactivitiesâ\\x80\\x94or lack thereofâ\\x80\\x94of serological responses. CONCLUSION: The advantages of the newly developed tool for assessing the antigen profiles of serological responses may ultimately lead to the identification of biomarkers associated with various disease stages and or protection against disease.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Available diagnostics often fail to distinguish viral from bacterial causes of pediatric communityâ\\x80\\x90acquired pneumonia (pCAP). Metabolomics, which aims at characterizing diseases based on their metabolic signatures, has been applied to expand pathophysiological understanding of many diseases. In this exploratory study, we used the untargeted metabolomic analysis to shed new light on the etiology of pCAP. METHODS: Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used to quantify the metabolite content of urine samples collected from children hospitalized for CAP of pneumococcal or viral etiology, ascertained using a conservative algorithm combining microbiological and biochemical data. RESULTS: Fiftyâ\\x80\\x90nine children with CAP were enrolled over 16 months. Pneumococcal and viral cases were distinguished by means of a multivariate model based on 93 metabolites, 20 of which were identified and considered as putative biomarkers. Among these, six metabolites belonged to the adrenal steroid synthesis and degradation pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that viral and pneumococcal pneumonia differently affect the systemic metabolome, with a stronger disruption of the adrenal steroid pathway in pneumococcal pneumonia. This finding may lead to the discovery of novel diagnostic biomarkers and bring us closer to personalized therapy for pCAP.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Approximately 30% of children worldwide are infected with gastrointestinal parasites. Depending on the species, parasites can disrupt intestinal bacterial microbiota affecting essential vitamin biosynthesis. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 37 asymptomatic children from a previous cross-sectional Argentinian study. A multi-parallel real-time quantitative PCR was implemented for Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichuris trichiura, Cryptosporidium spp., Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia duodenalis. In addition, whole-genome sequencing analysis was conducted for bacterial microbiota on all samples and analyzed using Livermore Metagenomic Analysis Toolkit and DIAMOND software. Separate analyses were carried out for uninfected, Giardia-only, Giardia + helminth co-infections, and helminth-only groups. RESULTS: For Giardia-only infected children compared to uninfected children, DNA sequencing data showed a decrease in microbiota biodiversity that correlated with increasing Giardia burden and was statistically significant using ShannonÊ¼s alpha diversity (Giardia-only > 1 fg/Âµl 2.346; non-infected group 3.253, P = 0.0317). An increase in diversity was observed for helminth-only infections with a decrease in diversity for Giardia + helminth co-infections (P = 0.00178). In Giardia-only infections, microbiome taxonomy changed from Firmicutes towards increasing proportions of Prevotella, with the degree of change related to the intensity of infection compared to uninfected (P = 0.0317). The abundance of Prevotella bacteria was decreased in the helminths-only group but increased for Giardia + helminth co-infections (P = 0.0262). Metagenomic analysis determined cobalamin synthesis was decreased in the Giardia > 1 fg/Âµl group compared to both the Giardia < 1 fg/Âµl and the uninfected group (P = 0.0369). Giardia + helminth group also had a decrease in cobalamin CbiM genes from helminth-only infections (P = 0.000754). CONCLUSION: The study results may provide evidence for an effect of parasitic infections enabling the permissive growth of anaerobic bacteria such as Prevotella, suggesting an altered capacity of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) biosynthesis and potential impact on growth and development in children [Image: see text].',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to investigate the relationships between arterial lactate levels and outcomes in severe acute pancreatitis. METHODS: The study retrospectively analyzed the medical data of 329 patients with severe acute pancreatitis from January 2014 to February 2019. We compared baseline characteristics, laboratory data, severity scores, types of persistent organ failure, and primary and secondary outcomes of patients with and without elevated arterial lactate levels at admission. A multivariate logistic regression analysis model and receiver operating characteristic curve were adopted to evaluate the value of arterial lactate â\\x89¥4 mmol/L for identifying high-risk patients. Trends in arterial lactate levels were compared between patients in the survivor and nonsurvivor groups over a period of 7 days. RESULTS: Compared to normal arterial lactate levels, patients with elevated arterial lactate levels show significantly higher incidences of multiple persistent organ failure (3% vs 30%, P < 0.01), death (2% vs 11%, P < 0.01), septic shock (4% vs 24%, P < 0.01), pancreatic infection (12% vs 37%, P < 0.01), abdominal compartment syndrome (3% vs 20%, P < 0.01), pancreatic necrosis (41% vs 63%, P < 0.01), and a need for ventilator support (26% vs 54%, P < 0.01). For predicting mortality, arterial lactate levels â\\x89¥4 mmol/L had a high hazard ratio (10, 95% CI; 3.7â\\x80\\x9327; P < 0.01) and the highest area under the curve (0.78). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that initially elevated arterial lactate is independently associated with poor outcomes and death in patients with severe acute pancreatitis and may serve as an early high-risk stratification indicator.',\n",

       " 'High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) can be a rescue for neonates with refractory respiratory failure or an early elective therapy for preterm infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). However, little is known about the current evolution and therapeutic limitations of HFOV. We therefore aimed to describe its use in clinical practice and predict the risk of mortality for neonates receiving HFOV. A retrospective observational study of all neonates treated with HFOV in a quaternary referral NICU between January 2007 and December 2016 was conducted. We classified these patients into five subgroups based on primary respiratory diagnoses. We performed the logistic regression and decision tree regression analyses to identify independent factors of 30-day mortality following HFOV. A total of 1125 patients who were ever supported on HFOV were enrolled, of whom 64.1% received HFOV as a rescue therapy, 27.2% received it as an elective therapy, and 8.7% received it for air leak. An average oxygenation index (OI) greater than 25 in the first 24 hours after the initiation of HFOV and patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension were found to have the greatest risk of in-hospital mortality (p < 0.0001). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 25.8% (290/1125). Decision tree regression analysis revealed that neonates with refractory respiratory failure who had a pre-HFOV OI value higher than 20.5 and OI values higher than 21.5, 23.5 and 34 at 2 hours, 6 hours, and 12 hours after the use of HFOV, respectively, had a significantly increased risk of 30-day mortality. We identified the predictors and cutoff points of OI before and after the initiation of HFOV in neonates with respiratory failure, which can be clinically used as a reference for 30-day mortality. Further efforts are still needed to optimize the outcomes.',\n",
       " 'Plasmodium falciparum merozoite invasion into erythrocytes is an essential step of the blood-stage cycle, survival of parasites, and malaria pathogenesis. P. falciparum merozoite Rh5 interacting protein (PfRipr) forms a complex with Rh5 and CyRPA in sequential molecular events leading to erythrocyte invasion. Recently we described PfRipr as a conserved protein that induces strain-transcending growth inhibitory antibodies in in vitro assays. However, being a large and complex protein of 1086 amino acids (aa) with 87 cysteine residues, PfRipr is difficult to express in conventional expression systems towards vaccine development. In this study we sought to identify the most potent region of PfRipr that could be developed to overcome difficulties related to protein expression, as well as to elucidate the invasion inhibitory mechanism of anti-PfRipr antibodies. Using the wheat germ cell-free system, Ecto- PfRipr and truncates of approximately 200 aa were expressed as soluble proteins. We demonstrate that antibodies against PfRipr truncate 5 (PfRipr_5: C(720)-D(934)), a region within the PfRipr C-terminal EGF-like domains, potently inhibit merozoite invasion. Furthermore, the antibodies strongly block PfRipr/Rh5 interaction, as well as that between PfRipr and its erythrocyte-surface receptor, SEMA7A. Taken together, PfRipr_5 is a potential candidate for further development as a blood-stage malaria vaccine.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Copepods are key components of aquatic ecosystems and can help regulate the global carbon cycle. Much attention has been paid to the species diversity of copepods worldwide, but the phylogeography and genetic diversity of copepods in Nigeria is unexplored. RESULTS: Using a mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I marker, we preformed phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses for Cyclopidae copepods in Southeast Nigeria. A high species diversity of Cyclopidae in Nigeria: 5 species of Tropocyclops, 5 species of Mesocyclops and 2 species of Thermocyclops from Cyclopidae were identified in 15 populations. Moreover, we detected 18 unique haplotypes, which fell into two distinct clades. Pairwise genetic distances (uncorrected p-distances) among the species of Cyclopidae ranged from 0.05 to 0.257. Several species co-existed in the same lake, and some haplotypes were shared among different geographic populations, suggesting a dispersal of Cyclopidae in our sampling region. Finally, we found that the population genetic diversity for each species of Cyclopidae was low in Nigeria. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings explored the species diversity and distribution of copepods within the family Cyclopidae for 15 Nigerian freshwater ecosystems: a high species diversity of Cyclopidae copepods was detected over a small geographic sampling range. Results from this study contribute to a better understanding of copepod diversity of Nigerian freshwater ecosystems.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: In endemic areas of zoonotic leishmaniosis caused by L. infantum, early detection of Leishmania infection in dogs is essential to control the dissemination of the parasite to humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the serological and/or molecular diagnostic performance of minimally and non-invasive samples (conjunctiva cells (CS) and peripheral blood (PB)) for monitoring Leishmania infection/exposure to Phlebotomus perniciosus salivary antigens in dogs at the beginning and the end of sand fly seasonal activity (May and October, respectively) and to assess associated risks factors. METHODS: A total of 208 sheltered dogs from endemic areas of leishmaniosis were screened. Leishmania DNA detection in PB on filter paper and CS was performed by nested-PCR (nPCR), while the detection of anti-Leishmania antibodies was performed using IFAT and ELISA. The exposure to P. perniciosus salivary antigens (SGH, rSP01 and rSP03B + rSP01) was measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Ninety-seven (46.6%) and 116 (55.8%) of the 208 dogs were positive to Leishmania antibodies or DNA by at least one test at the beginning and end of the sand fly season, respectively. IFAT and ELISA presented a substantial agreement in the serodiagnosis of leishmaniosis. Discrepant PB nPCR results were obtained between sampling points. Leishmania DNA was detected in CS of 72 dogs at the end of the phlebotomine season. The presence of antibodies to the parasite measured by ELISA was significantly higher in dogs presenting clinical signs compatible with leishmaniosis at both sampling points. Phlebotomus perniciosus salivary antibodies were detected in 179 (86.1%) and 198 (95.2%) of the screened dogs at the beginning and end of the phlebotomine season, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The association between ELISA positivity and clinical signs suggests its usefulness to confirm a clinical suspicion. CS nPCR seems to be an effective and non-invasive method for assessing early exposure to the parasite. PB nPCR should not be used as the sole diagnostic tool to monitor Leishmania infection. The correlation between the levels of antibodies to P. perniciosus saliva and Leishmania antibodies suggests the use of a humoral response to sand fly salivary antigens as biomarkers of L. infantum infection.

In animals, Ste24 processes prelamin A, a component of the nuclear lamina; mutations in the human ortholog of Ste24 diminish its activity, giving rise to genetic diseases of accelerated aging (progerias).

However, randomized evidence of its clinical effectiveness is lacking. We compared MMD within community ART refill groups (CARGs) vs. standard-of-care facility-based ART delivery in Zimbabwe. METHODS: A three-arm, cluster-randomized, pragmatic noninferiority trial was performed. Thirty health care facilities and associated CARGs were allocated to either ART collected three-monthly at facility (3MF, control); ART delivered three-monthly in CARGs (3MC); or ART delivered six-monthly in CARGs (6MC). Stable adults receiving ART â\\x89¥six months with baseline viral load (VL) <1000 copies/ml were eligible. Retention in ART care (primary outcome) and viral suppression (VS) 12 months after enrollment were compared, using regression models specified for clustering (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03238846). RESULTS: 4800 participants were recruited, 1919, 1335, and 1546 in arms 3MF, 3MC, and 6MC, respectively. For retention, the prespecified noninferiority limit (-3.25%, risk difference [RD]) was met for comparisons between all arms, 3MC (94.8%) vs. 3MF (93.0%), adjusted RD = 1.1% (95% CI: -0.5% to 2.8%); 6MC (95.5%) vs. 3MF: aRD = 1.2% (95% CI: -1.0% to 3.6%); and 6MC vs. 3MC: aRD = 0.1% (95% CI: -2.4% to 2.6%). VL completion at 12 months was 49%, 45%, and 8% in 3MF, 3MC, and 6MC, respectively. VS in 3MC (99.7%) was high and not different to 3MF (99.1%), relative risk = 1.0 (95% CI: 1.0-1.0). VS was marginally reduced in 6MC (92.9%) vs. 3MF, relative risk = 0.9 (95% CI: 0.9-1.0). CONCLUSION: Retention in CARGs receiving three- and six-monthly MMD was noninferior versus standard-of-care facility-based ART delivery. VS in 3MC was high. VS in six-monthly CARGs requires further evaluation.',\n",

       " 'The nonstructural (NS) protein NS3/4A protease is a critical factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) maturation that requires activation by NS4A. Synthetic peptide mutants of NS4A were found to inhibit NS3 function. The bridging from peptide inhibitors to heterocyclic peptidomimetics of NS4A has not been considered in the literature and, therefore, we decided to explore this strategy for developing a new class of NS3 inhibitors. In this report, a structure-based design approach was used to convert the bound form of NS4A into 1H-imidazole-2,5-dicarboxamide derivatives as first generation peptidomimetics. This scaffold mimics the buried amino acid sequence Ile-25` to Arg-28` at the core of NS4A(21`â\\x80\\x9333`) needed to activate the NS3 protease. Some of the synthesized compounds (Coded MOC) were able to compete with and displace NS4A(21`â\\x80\\x9333`) for binding to NS3. For instance, N(5)-(4-guanidinobutyl)-N(2)-(n-hexyl)-1H-imidazole-2,5-dicarboxamide (MOC-24) inhibited the binding of NS4A(21`â\\x80\\x9333`) with a competition half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 1.9 Â± 0.12 ÂµM in a fluorescence anisotropy assay and stabilized the denaturation of NS3 by increasing the aggregation temperature (40% compared to NS4A(21`â\\x80\\x9333`)). MOC-24 also inhibited NS3 protease activity in a fluorometric assay. Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to rationalize the differences in structureâ\\x80\\x93activity relationship (SAR) between the active MOC-24 and the inactive MOC-26.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Severe accidental hypothermia is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) provides an efficient rewarming method with complete cardiopulmonary support. The use of VA-ECMO for this indication has greatly improved the vital and functional prognosis of patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 46-year-old patient who was treated for severe hypothermia with a temperature of 22.4 Â°C along with initial cardiac arrest, whose progression was favorable after the implementation of VA-ECMO support. Two months after initial cardiac arrest, the patient was reassessed and showed signs of complete recovery with regard to his mental and physical capacities. CONCLUSIONS: The recent international publications and groups of experts recommend the use of VA ECMO as the gold standard therapy to treat severe hypothermia. Therefore, it seems suitable to update the current knowledge on the topic by analysing the latest international publications. The performance of this technique calls into question ethical and economic factors. Two distinct medical teams tried to identify and regroup prognosis factors in predictive survival scores. They raise the question of the utility of these scores in clinical practice. Indeed, according to which survival rate should we proceed to prolonged resuscitation and implement VA-ECMO? Additional studies will be needed for external approval of these survival scores, and additional reflection by experts will be required.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: The prevalence of infections due to carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is on the rise worldwide. Polymyxins are considered as last-resort drugs for CRAB infections, but there is still controversy regarding the efficacy and safety of polymyxins based therapies in CRAB infections. The present systematic review was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of polymyxins based therapies versus non-polymyxins based therapies in CRAB infections. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov to identify eligible studies reporting the clinical outcomes of patients with CRAB infections. The meta-analysis employed a random-effects model to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary outcome was 1-month mortality for any cause. We also examined clinical response, microbiological response, length of stay in hospital, and adverse events. RESULTS: Eleven eligible studies were analyzed (1052 patients in total), including 2 randomized clinical trials. Serious risk of bias was found in 8 out of the 11 studies. There was no statistically significant difference between polymyxins based therapies and non-polymyxins based therapies in 1-month mortality for any cause (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.53), microbiological response (OR, 3.83; 95% CI, 0.90 to 16.29) and length of stay in hospital (SMD, 0.24; 95% CI, â\\x88\\x92 0.08 to 0.56). The pooled OR of clinical response indicated a significant difference in favor of polymyxin based therapies (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.31 to 3.03). The pooled OR of adverse events showed that non-polymyxins based therapies were associated with fewer adverse events (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 1.39 to 13.48). CONCLUSION: The performance of polymyxins based therapies was better than non-polymyxin based therapies in clinical response rate and similar to non-polymyxin based therapies in terms of 1-month mortality and microbiological response in treating CRAB infections. Due to the limitations of our study, we cannot draw a firm conclusion on the optimal treatment of CRAB infections, but polymyxins would be a relatively effective treatment for CRAB infections. Adequate and well-designed large scale randomized controlled trials are required to clarify the relative efficacy of polymyxins based and non-polymyxins based therapies.',\n",

While knowledge about CanL, its management, treatment, prevention and control mounts, it remains unclear whether all clinical veterinarians follow the same international recommendations, such as those of the LeishVet group. This study was thus designed to assess recent trends in the clinical management of CanL in veterinary clinics across Spain through a questionnaire-based survey. Results were compared with those of a prior national multicenter questionnaire administered by our research team in 2005. METHODS: A questionnaire consisting of 28 questions about CanL was developed using Google Forms and distributed by email to 1428 veterinary clinics in Spain. Questions were designed to obtain data on common clinical signs, techniques and complementary exams used to diagnose the disease, and on its monitoring, treatment and control measures. Data were collected in a database for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were returned by 295 clinics. Compared to the situation in 2005, responses indicate that clinical signs of CanL have not changed significantly, cutaneous lesions being still the most prevalent sign observed by practitioners. Quantitative serological techniques are considered an adequate approach to diagnosis, provided their results are supported by the findings of a thorough physical exam, as well as complementary tests (complete blood count, biochemical profile, plasma protein electrophoretogram and complete urinalysis). Treatment protocols and check-ups follow international recommendations. Finally, a multimodal approach is being endorsed to adequately control CanL including preventive measures such as annual serological check-ups and the combination of repellents and vaccines. Additionally, owners are being better informed about CanL by veterinarians, which translates to the improved control of this zoonosis. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical management of CanL has recently undergone significant changes owing to improvements in clinical knowledge of the disease, more unified international criteria, improved diagnostic techniques and their adequate interpretation, as well as a greater awareness of the disease transmitted to owners.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Patients with oncologic diseases, particularly those with hematologic malignancies, are at an increased risk of common infections and unique treatment-related complications with high mortality and morbidity. The annual incidence and prevalence of cancer in Germany is rising. Although modern treatments have generally led to improved survival, increasing age, comorbidities, and frailty of the patients require multidisciplinary strategies for handling complex therapeutic concepts and treatment of the associated complications. METHODS: A selective literature search and guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology (Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r HÃ¤matologie und Medizinische Onkologie, DGHO), the Infectious Diseases Working Group of the DGHO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Infektionen in der HÃ¤matologie und Onkologie, AGIHO), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) formed the basis of this study. CONCLUSION: Recognition of severe infections in cancer patients and their discrimination from treatment-associated complications is a challenge. Neutropenic fever is the most frequent infectious emergency in oncology. Early empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and escalated diagnostic strategies are needed to successfully treat this vulnerable patient group. In this article, a range of potentially life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients are discussed.',\n",

This difficult problem must be solved. Early warning is the most effective way to solve this problem. Here, we aim to determine the best performing model to track the epidemic of AIDS, which will provide a methodological basis for testing the time characteristics of the disease. From January 2004 to January 2018, we built four computing methods based on AIDS dataset: BPNN model, RNN model, LSTM model and MHPSO-GRU model. Compare the final estimated performance to determine the preferred method. Result. Considering the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean error rate (MER) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in the simulation and prediction subsets, the MHPSO-GRU model is determined as the best performance technology. Estimates for the period from May 2018 to December 2020 suggest that the event appears to continue to increase and remain high.',\n",
       " 'Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that can lead towards death if left untreated. TB detection involves extraction of complex TB manifestation features such as lung cavity, air space consolidation, endobronchial spread, and pleural effusions from chest x-rays (CXRs). Deep learning based approach named convolutional neural network (CNN) has the ability to learn complex features from CXR images. The main problem is that CNN does not consider uncertainty to classify CXRs using softmax layer. It lacks in presenting the true probability of CXRs by differentiating confusing cases during TB detection. This paper presents the solution for TB identification by using Bayesian-based convolutional neural network (B-CNN). It deals with the uncertain cases that have low discernibility among the TB and non-TB manifested CXRs. The proposed TB identification methodology based on B-CNN is evaluated on two TB benchmark datasets, i.e., Montgomery and Shenzhen. For training and testing of proposed scheme we have utilized Google Colab platform which provides NVidia Tesla K80 with 12 GB of VRAM, single core of 2.3 GHz Xeon Processor, 12 GB RAM and 320 GB of disk. B-CNN achieves 96.42% and 86.46% accuracy on both dataset, respectively as compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning and CNN approaches. Moreover, B-CNN validates its results by filtering the CXRs as confusion cases where the variance of B-CNN predicted outputs is more than a certain threshold. Results prove the supremacy of B-CNN for the identification of TB and non-TB sample CXRs as compared to counterparts in terms of accuracy, variance in the predicted probabilities and model uncertainty.',\n",
       " 'Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a multi-host pathogen that can cause significant mortality in domestic, wild terrestrial and marine mammals. It is a major conservation threat in some endangered species. Infection can result in severe respiratory disease and fatal encephalitis. Diagnosis and disease monitoring in wildlife, and differentiation of CDV from rabies (a life-threatening zoonotic disease that can produce similar neurologic signs), would benefit from the availability of a portable, point-of-care (POC) diagnostic test. We therefore developed a quantitative RT-PCR assay for CDV using shelf-stable, lyophilized reagents and target-specific primers and probes for use with the handheld Biomeme two3(â\\x84¢) qPCR thermocycler. Biomemeâ\\x80\\x99s extraction methodology, lyophilized reagents, and thermocycler were compared to our standard laboratory-based methods to assess sensitivity, efficiency and overall test performance. Results using a positive control plasmid for CDV showed comparable sensitivity (detection of 50 copies) and PCR efficiency between the two platforms, and CDV detection was similar between platforms when tested using a modified live CDV vaccine. Significantly higher Ct values (average Ct = 5.1 cycles) were observed using the Biomeme platform on known CDV positive animal samples. CDV detection using the Biomeme platform was similar in 25 of 26 samples from suspect CDV cases when compared to standard virology laboratory testing. One false positive was observed that was negative upon retest. The Biomeme methodology can be adapted for detection of specific targets, and this portable technology saves time by eliminating the need for local or international sample transport for laboratory-based diagnostics. However, results of our testing suggest that decreased diagnostic sensitivity (higher Ct values) relative to laboratory-based methods was observed using animal samples, so careful validation and optimization are essential. Portable qPCR platforms can empower biologists and wildlife health professionals in remote and low-resource settings, which will greatly improve our understanding of CDV disease ecology and associated conservation threats in wildlife.',\n",

       " 'Human-plasma-derived immune globulin (IG) is used in augmentation therapy to provide protective levels of antibodies to patients with primary immune deficiency diseases (PIDD) and for prophylaxis against infectious diseases. To maintain the breadth of antibodies necessary for clinical protection, it is important to understand regional patterns of antibody seroprevalence in source plasma from which IG products are manufactured. In this study, source plasma from donation centers in various locations of the Southwestern quarter of the United States was surveyed for antibody titers to hepatitis A virus (HAV), measles virus (MeV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). A broad range of anti-HAV Ig plasma titers was observed among these centers, with some centers exhibiting 3â\\x80\\x935 times the titers of the others. Minor to no differences were observed for levels of anti-MeV and anti-CMV, respectively. Importantly, elevated anti-HAV Ig titers were broadly observed across plasma units obtained from the centers exhibiting high titers, indicative of a potential regional phenomenon among donors as opposed to few donors with singularly high titers. Plasma from these high-titer centers conferred significantly greater neutralization against HAV in vitro. The outcomes of this study give a glimpse of the antibody diversity inherent in human plasma used to manufacture IG products..',\n",

The main result is that, despite facing potentially more challenging collective action problems, countries with individualistic cultures are more likely to end up adopting democracy earlier than countries with collectivist cultures. Our empirical analysis suggests a strong and robust association between individualistic cultures and average polity scores and durations of democracy, even after controlling for other determinants of democracy emphasized in the literature. We provide evidence that countries with collectivist cultures also are more likely to experience autocratic breakdowns and transitions from autocracy to autocracy.',\n",

       " 'Emergency nurses frequently encounter uncertainty and changes during the management of emerging infectious diseases, which challenge their capability to perform their duties in a well-planned and systematic manner. To date, little is known about the coping strategies adopted by emergency nurses in addressing uncertainty and changes during an epidemic event. The present study explored emergency nursesâ\\x80\\x99 behaviours and strategies in handling uncertainty and practice changes during an epidemic event. A qualitative study based on the Straussian grounded theory approach was established. Semi-structured, face-to-face, individual interviews were conducted with 26 emergency nurses for data collection. Adapting protocol to the evolving context of practice was revealed as the core category. Four interplaying subcategories were identified: (1) Completing a comprehensive assessment, (2) continuing education for emerging infectious disease management, (3) incorporating guideline updates and (4) navigating new duties and competencies. The nurses demonstrated the prudence to orientate themselves to an ambiguous work situation and displayed the ability to adapt and embrace changes in their practice and duties. These findings offer insights into the need for education and training schemes that allow emergency nurses to acquire and develop the necessary decision-making and problem-solving skills to handle a public health emergency.',\n",
       " 'Rapid population migration has been viewed as a critical factor impacting urban network construction and regional sustainable development. The supervision and analysis of population migration are necessary for guiding the optimal allocation of urban resources and for attaining the high efficiency development of region. Currently, the explorations of population migration are often restricted by the limitation of data. In the information era, search engines widely collect public attention, implying potential individual actions, and freely provide open, timelier, and large-scope search query data for helping explore regional phenomena and problems. In this paper, we endeavor to explore the possibility of adopting such data to depict population migration. Based on the search query from Baidu search engine, three migration attention indexes (MAIs) are constructed to capture public migration attention in cyber space. Taking three major urban agglomerations in China as case study, we conduct the correlation analysis among the cyber MAIs and population migration in geographical space. Results have shown that external-MAI and local-MAI can positively reflect the population migration inner regions and across regions from a holistic lens and that intercity-MAI can be a helpful supplement for the delineation of specific population flow. Along with the accumulation of cyber search query data, its potential in exploring population migration can be further reinforced.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: A predictive scoring system for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients, which incorporates age, PaO(2)/FlO(2), and plateau pressure, APPS, was developed recently. It was validated externally in a Caucasian population but has not been studied in Asian populations. The aim of this study was to validate APPS in Korean ARDS patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who were diagnosed with ARDS using the Berlin criteria and admitted to the medical ICU at Seoul National University Hospital from January 2015 to December 2016. The validation of the APPS was performed by evaluating its calibration and predictive accuracy. Its calibration was plotted and quantified using the Hosmerâ\\x80\\x93Lemeshow test. Its predictive accuracy was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUCâ\\x80\\x93ROC) curve. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients were analyzed, 32 of whom survived. Of the 116 patients, 11 (9.5%) were classified as APPS grade 1 (score 3â\\x80\\x934), 88 (75.9%) as grade 2 (score 5â\\x80\\x937) and 17 (14.6%) as grade 3 (score 8â\\x80\\x939). In-hospital mortality was 27.3% for grade 1, 73.9% for grade 2 and 94.1% for grade 3 (P for trend < 0.001). The APPS was well calibrated (Hosmerâ\\x80\\x93Lemeshow test, P = 0.578) and its predictive accuracy was acceptable (AUCâ\\x80\\x93ROC 0.704, 95% confidence interval 0.599â\\x80\\x930.809). CONCLUSIONS: The APPS predicted in-hospital mortality in Korean patients with ARDS with similar power to its application in a Western population and with acceptable predictive accuracy.

       " 'The host cell protease TMPRSS2 cleaves the influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA). Several reports have described resistance of Tmprss2(â\\x88\\x92/â\\x88\\x92) knock-out (KO) mice to IAV infection but IAV of the H2 subtype have not been examined yet. Here, we demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is able to cleave H2-HA in cell culture and that Tmprss2(â\\x88\\x92/â\\x88\\x92) mice are resistant to infection with a re-assorted PR8_HA(H2) virus. Infection of KO mice did not cause major body weight loss or death. Furthermore, no significant increase in lung weights and no virus replication were observed in Tmprss2(â\\x88\\x92/â\\x88\\x92) mice. Finally, only minor tissue damage and infiltration of immune cells were detected and no virus-positive cells were found in histological sections of Tmprss2(â\\x88\\x92/â\\x88\\x92) mice. In summary, our studies indicate that TMPRSS2 is required for H2 IAV spread and pathogenesis in mice. These findings extend previous results pointing towards a central role of TMPRSS2 in IAV infection and validate host proteases as a potential target for antiviral therapy.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Prophylactic vaccines are critical in preventing hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) primarily caused by human enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. Children aged less than 5 years are especially susceptible to EV71 infections. In addition to the development of vaccines containing the inactivated virus, those containing virus-like particles (VLPs) with repeated antigens also constitute an effective preventive strategy for EV71 infections, with safety and productivity advantages. We previously developed a fusion protein composed with truncated peptides of the EV71 capsid protein, which assembled into spherical particles. This study aimed to assess the immunoprotective effects of this fusion protein as a vaccine candidate in a mouse model of EV71 infection. METHODS: To evaluate the protective effect of fusion protein vaccine candidate, neonatal mice born by immunized female mice, as well as normal neonatal mice immunized twice were infected with EV71 virus. Whereafter, the survival rates, clinical scores and viral loads were measured. RESULTS: The high dosage and booster immunization helped induce specific serum antibodies with high neutralization titers, which were transferred to neonatal mice, thereby facilitating effective resistance towards EV71 infection. An active immune response was also observed in neonatal mice which generated following immunization. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that this fusion protein is a suitable vaccine candidate in treating EV71 infections.',\n",
       " 'The present work aims to design and synthesize novel series of spiro pyrazole-3,3â\\x80\\x99-oxindoles analogues and investigate their bioactivity as antioxidant and antimicrobial agents, as well as antiproliferative potency against selected human cancerous cell lines (i.e., breast, MCF-7; colon, HCT-116 and liver, HepG-2) relative to healthy noncancerous control skin fibroblast cells (BJ-1). The mechanism of their cytotoxic activity has been also examined by immunoassaying the levels of key anti- and proapoptotic protein markers. The analytical and spectral data of the all synthesized target congeners were compatible with their structures. Synthesized compounds showed diverse moderate to powerful antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Results of MTT assay revealed that seven synthesized compounds (i.e., 11a, 11b, 12a, 12b, 13b, 13c and 13h) particularly exhibited significant cytotoxicity against the three cancerous cell lines under investigation. Ranges of IC(50) values obtained were 5.7â\\x80\\x9321.3 and 5.8â\\x80\\x9337.4 Âµg/mL against HCT-116 and MCF-7, respectively; which is 3.8 and 6.5-fold (based on the least IC(50) values) more significant relative to the reference chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. In HepG-2 cells, the analogue 13h exhibited the highest cytotoxicity with IC(50) value of 19.2Âµg/mL relative to doxorubicin (IC(50) = 21.6Âµg/mL). The observed cytotoxicity was specific to cancerous cells, as evidenced by the minimal toxicity in the noncancerous control skin-fibroblast cells. ELISA results indicated that the observed antiproliferative effect against examined cancer cell lines is mediated via engaging the activation of apoptosis as illustrated by the significant increase in proapoptotic protein markers (p53, bax and caspase-3) and reduction in the antiapoptotic marker bcl-2. Taken together, results of the present study emphasize the potential of spiro pyrazole-oxindole analogues as valuable candidate anticancer agents against human cancer cells.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Risk factors affecting the prognosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults were investigated. The aim was to identify new predictors for ARDS patient prognosis, including those with clinical, pathophysiological, and atypical immunodeficiency. METHODS: ARDS patients were retrospectively included. The patients were grouped and analysed according to different oxygenation index grades and prognosis, and factors influencing prognosis and survival were examined. Adolescent patients, patients with typical immunodeficiency and patients who died within 24 h after being diagnosed with ARDS were excluded. The predictive value for mortality was determined by Cox proportional hazard analysis. RESULTS: In total, 201 patients who fulfilled the Berlin definition of ARDS were included. The severity of critical illness on the day of enrolment, as measured by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (P = 0.016), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (P = 0.027), and PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P = 0.000), worsened from mild to severe ARDS cases. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were significantly older and had higher APACHE II and SOFA scores. Moreover, significantly lower lymphocyte/neutrophil ratios and leukocyte counts were found among non-survivors than survivors (P = 0.008, P = 0.012). A moderate positive correlation between the lymphocyte/neutrophil and PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios (P = 0.023) was observed. In predicting 100-day survival in patients with ARDS, the area under the curve (AUC) for the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio was significantly higher than those for the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio alone, body mass index (BMI) alone, and the lymphocyte count alone (P = 0.0062, 0.0001, and 0.0154). Age (per log(10) years), BMI < 24, SOFA score, leukocyte count, and the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio were independent predictors of 28-day mortality in ARDS patients. Additionally, ARDS patients with a lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio < 0.0537 had increased 28-day mortality rates (P = 0.0283). Old age affected both 28-day and 100-day mortality rates (P = 0.0064,0.0057). CONCLUSIONS: Age (per log(10) years), BMI < 24, SOFA score, lymphocytes, and the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio were independent predictors of 100-day mortality in patients with ARDS. The lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio may represent a potential molecular marker to evaluate atypical immunosuppression or impairment in patients with ARDS.',\n",

       " 'Despite being a leading cause of severe respiratory disease, there remains no licensed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. Neutralizing antibodies reduce the severity of RSV-associated disease, but are not sufficient for preventing reinfection. In contrast, the role of memory CD8 T cells in protecting against a secondary RSV infection is less established. We recently demonstrated that high-magnitude memory CD8 T cells efficiently reduced lung viral titers following RSV infection, but induced fatal immunopathology that was mediated by IFN-Î³. To evaluate the ability of RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies to prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology, mice with high-magnitude memory CD8 T cell responses were treated with neutralizing antibodies prior to RSV challenge. Neutralizing antibody treatment significantly reduced morbidity and prevented mortality following RSV challenge compared with IgG-treated controls. Neutralizing antibody treatment restricted early virus replication, which caused a substantial reduction in memory CD8 T cell activation and IFN-Î³ production, directly resulting in survival. In contrast, therapeutic neutralizing antibody administration did not impact morbidity, mortality, or IFN-Î³ levels, despite significantly reducing lung viral titers. Therefore, only pre-existing neutralizing antibodies prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology following RSV infection. Overall, our results have important implications for the development of future RSV vaccines.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: Evaluating cirrhotic severity is essential for individualizing surgical modalities for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our previous study proposed a non-invasive method named cirrhotic severity scoring (CSS) to stage liver cirrhosis. Indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICG-R15) has been widely used for the preoperative evaluation of hepatic functional reserve; however, whether ICG-R15 is well correlated with cirrhotic severity, and especially whether comparable with CSS in predicting cirrhotic severity in HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function remains unknown. METHODS: Overall, 510 HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function undergoing hepatectomy between January 2011 and December 2014 were retrospectively studied. Cirrhotic severity was pathologically assessed using the Laennec staging system. The correlations between ICG-R15, CSS, and cirrhotic severity were analyzed. Furthermore, the performance of ICG-R15 and CSS in predicting posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) and 90-day mortality was compared. RESULTS: Patients with no, mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis accounted for 15.9%, 29.2%, 35.9%, and 19.0%, respectively, in the entire cohort. ICG-R15 was found to be less than 10% in 100%, 93.3%, 86.3%, and 70.1% of the patients with no, mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis, respectively. There was only a weak correlation between ICG-R15 and the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis (r = 0.325; P < 0.001). However, CSS showed a strong correlation with the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis (r = 0.788; P < 0.001). For those with ICG-R15 in the normal range, the accuracy of CSS in diagnosing no/mild, moderate, and severe cirrhosis was 89.1%, 72.8%, and 72.1%, respectively. In addition, CSS was superior to ICG-R15 in predicting PHLF and 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CSS was more useful than ICG-R15 in the preoperative assessment of cirrhotic severity in HCC patients with Child-Pugh grade A liver function. More studies are needed to further validate CSS in patients with different Child-Pugh grades.',\n",

To ensure high quality of the trial intervention as well as of patient care, we have developed a multilingual web-based training program to train relevant staff and test their competence. As we enter an under-explored area of e-learning, we have conducted a pilot study on the first of the five modules comprising the web-based training program to test the feasibility of developing such a program for an international trial with limited resources. METHODS: The module in this study focuses on the principles and practice of NIRS monitoring. The pedagogical idea was to integrate training and certification. One-hundred doctors and nurses from five Neonatal Intensive Care Units across China, Spain and Denmark were invited to participate in the pilot study. Upon completion of the NIRS module, participants were invited to evaluate their experience by completing an online survey. Data from closed-ended questions were analysed using descriptive statistics while data from open-ended questions underwent thematic analysis. RESULTS: In total, 81 of 100 invited staff members entered the training module and completed the online survey. The median time and the number of questions to pass the module was 15 minutes and seven questions, respectively. Most staff found the academic level of the learning material and quiz appropriate (85% and 93% of all staff members, respectively), as well as agreeing that the module was relevant to prepare them to â\\x80\\x98use the NIRS deviceâ\\x80\\x99 (90%). Thematic analysis revealed issues such as a discrepancy between learning material and quiz questions, lack of clarity, and technical issues. CONCLUSION: We provide evidence of the feasibility of developing a multilingual web-based training program for an international trial, despite challenges such as low budget, language barriers and possibly differences in the clinical training of staff.

We aimed to investigate an association between viral LRTI at <5 years and the development of atopy at > 2 years. METHODS: We conducted a search at Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus. We collected data from the included articles. We estimated the odds ratio and the 95% confidence intervals with a random effect model. We determined factors associated with atopy development after childhood LRTI using univariate and multivariate meta-regression analyses. We recorded this systematic review at PROSPERO with the number CRD42018116955. RESULTS: We included 24 studies. There was no relationship between viral LRTI at <5 years and skin prick test-diagnosed-atopy (OR = 1.2, [95% CI = 0.7â\\x80\\x932.0]), unknown diagnosed-atopy (OR = 0.7, [95% CI = 0.4â\\x80\\x931.3]), atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.2, [95% CI = 0.9â\\x80\\x931.6]), hyperreactivity to pollen (OR = 0.8, [95% CI = 0.3â\\x80\\x932.7]), food (OR = 0.8, [95% CI = 0.3â\\x80\\x932.5]), or house dust mite (OR = 1.1, [95% CI = 0.6â\\x80\\x932.2]). Although not confirmed in all studies with a symmetric distribution of the 23 confounding factors investigated, the overall analyses showed that there was a relationship between childhood viral LRTI at < 5 years and serum test diagnosed-atopy (OR = 2.0, [95% CI = 1.0â\\x80\\x934.1]), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (OR = 1.7, [95% CI = 1.1â\\x80\\x932.9]), hyperreactivity diagnosed by serum tests with food (OR = 5.3, [1.7â\\x80\\x9316.7]) or inhaled allergens (OR = 4.2, [95% CI = 2.1â\\x80\\x938.5]), or furred animals (OR = 0.6, [95% CI = 0.5â\\x80\\x930.9]). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that there is no association between viral LRTI at < 5 years and the majority of categories of atopy studied during this work. These results, however, are not confirmed for the remaining categories of atopy and more particularly those diagnosed by serum tests. There is a real need to develop more accurate atopy diagnostic tools.',\n",
       " 'The Flaviviridae is a family of enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. It contains many viruses that threaten human health, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and yellow fever virus (YFV) of the genus Flavivirus as well as hepatitis C virus of the genus Hepacivirus. Cell culture systems highly permissive for the Flaviviridae viruses are very useful for their isolation, propagation, and diagnosis, an understanding of their biology, and the development of vaccines and antiviral agents. Previously, we isolated a human hepatoma HuH-7-derived cell clone, Huh7.5.1â\\x80\\x938, which is highly permissive to hepatitis C virus infection. Here, we have characterized flavivirus infection in the Huh7.5.1â\\x80\\x938 cell line by comparing with that in the African green monkey kidney-derived Vero cell line, which is permissive for a wide spectrum of viruses. Upon infection with JEV, Huh7.5.1â\\x80\\x938 cells produced a higher amount of virus particles early in infection and were more susceptible to virus-induced cell death than Vero cells. Similar outcomes were obtained when the cells were infected with another flavivirus, YFV (17D-204 strain). Quantification of cellular and extracellular viral RNA revealed that high JEV production in Huh7.5.1â\\x80\\x938 cells can be attributed to rapid viral replication kinetics and efficient virus release early in infection. In a plaque assay, Huh7.5.1â\\x80\\x938 cells developed JEV plaques more rapidly than Vero cells. Although this was not the case with YFV plaques, Huh7.5.1â\\x80\\x938 cells developed higher numbers of YFV plaques than Vero cells. Sequence analysis of cDNA encoding an antiviral RNA helicase, RIG-I, showed that Huh7.5.1â\\x80\\x938 cells expressed not only a full-length RIG-I mRNA with a known dominant-negative missense mutation but also variants without the mutation. However, the latter mRNAs lacked exon 5/6â\\x88\\x9212, indicating functional loss of RIG-I in the cells. These characteristics of the Huh7.5.1â\\x80\\x938 cell line are helpful for flavivirus detection, titration, and propagation.',\n",

       " 'BACKGROUND: INTELLiVENT-ASVÂ® (I-ASV) is a closed-loop ventilation mode that automatically controls the ventilation settings. Although a number of studies have reported the usefulness of I-ASV, the clinical situations in which it may be useful have not yet been clarified. We aimed to report our initial 3 years of experience using I-ASV, particularly the clinical conditions and the technical and organizational factors associated with its use. Furthermore, we evaluated the usefulness of I-ASV and determined the predictive factors for successful management with I-ASV. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective observational study included patients who were ventilated using the Hamilton G5Â® ventilator (Hamilton Medical AG, RhÃ¤zÃ¼ns, Switzerland) from January 2016 to December 2018. The patients were categorized into the â\\x80\\x9cI-ASV successâ\\x80\\x9d group and â\\x80\\x9cI-ASV failureâ\\x80\\x9d group (those receiving mechanical ventilation with I-ASV along with any other mode). Multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with successful I-ASV management. RESULTS: Of the 189 patients, 135 (71.4%) were categorized into the I-ASV success group. In the I-ASV success group, the reasons for ICU admission included post-elective surgery (94.1%), post-emergent surgery (81.5%), and other medical reasons (55.6%). I-ASV failure was associated with a low P/F ratio (278 vs. 167, P = 0.0003) and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (21 vs. 26, P < 0.0001). The main reasons for not using I-ASV included strong inspiratory effort and asynchrony. The APACHE II score was an independent predictive factor for successful management with I-ASV, with an odds ratio of 0.92 (95% confidential interval 0.87â\\x80\\x930.96, P = 0.0006). The area under the receiver operating curve for the APACHE II score was 0.722 (cut-off: 24). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that 71.4% of the fully mechanically ventilated patients could be managed successfully with I-ASV. The APACHE II score was an independent factor that could help predict the successful management of I-ASV. To improve I-ASV management, it is necessary to focus on patient-ventilator interactions.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation (MV), compared to spontaneous breathing (SB), has been found to increase abdominal edema and inflammation in experimental sepsis. Our hypothesis was that in primary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) MV would enhance inflammation and edema in the abdomen. METHODS: Thirteen piglets were randomized into two groups (SB and MV) after the induction of ARDS by lung lavage and 1 h of injurious ventilation. 1. SB: continuous positive airway pressure 15 cmH(2)O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO(2)) 0.5 and respiratory rate (RR) maintained at about 40 cycles min(â\\x88\\x92 1) by titrating remifentanil infusion. 2. MV: volume control, tidal volume 6 ml kg(â\\x88\\x92 1), positive end-expiratory pressure 15 cmH(2)O, RR 40 cycles min(â\\x88\\x92 1), FIO(2) 0.5. Main outcomes: abdominal edema, assessed by tissues histopathology and wet-dry weight; abdominal inflammation, assessed by cytokine concentration in tissues, blood and ascites, and tissue histopathology. RESULTS: The groups did not show significant differences in hemodynamic or respiratory parameters. Moreover, edema and inflammation in the abdominal organs were similar. However, blood IL6 increased in the MV group in all vascular beds (p < 0.001). In addition, TNFÎ± ratio in blood increased through the lungs in MV group (+ 26% Â± 3) but decreased in the SB group (â\\x88\\x92 17% Â± 3). CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences between the MV and SB group for abdominal edema or inflammation. However, the systemic increase in IL6 and the TNFÎ± increase through the lungs suggest that MV, in this model, was harmful to the lungs.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is a potentially fatal zoonosis. It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including diffuse alveolar haemorrhage which occurs in a minority of cases but carries a mortality of over 70%. These patients may present with severe acute respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis for diffuse alveolar haemorrhage is broad whereas prompt diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old previously fit and well trout farm worker presented with a 3-day history of malaise, fevers, diarrhoea, vomiting and jaundice. He developed haemoptysis, severe headaches, neck stiffness and photophobia on the day of emergency admission. He was anaemic and thrombocytopenic. Anuric acute kidney injury (urea 32, creat 507) required immediate haemofiltration. In view of progressive respiratory failure with four-quadrant lung infiltrates on imaging, he was given broad spectrum antibiotics and pulsed methylprednisolone empirically, in case of a vasculitic pulmonary-renal presentation. He was intubated within 48 h of admission. Despite attempted protective ventilatory management, he remained hypoxaemic and developed pneumomediastinum. He was retrieved to a specialist cardiorespiratory intensive care unit on femoro-femoral mobile VV-ECMO. Three days from admission, results showed positive Leptospira IgM and real-time PCR. Serial bronchoscopies showed old and fresh clots, but not the classical progressive late red tinge of the returned lavage fluid. After eight days, VV-ECMO was weaned, he was extubated three days later, and made a full recovery. At 9 months follow-up, he was clinically better, with resolution of the CT scan findings and near normal lung function, albeit with low normal gas transfer. CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis is a rare but important differential to be considered in diffuse alveolar haemorrhage presenting to the ICU, especially in young males. A thorough history for occupational or recreational risk factors may offer the diagnostic clue. Most patients recover fully with antibiotics. However, resulting acute severe respiratory failure can ensue. In this situation, early consideration for respiratory ECMO support offers time for clearance of endobronchial clot, parenchymal recovery, and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury. Steroids have no clear evidence but may be used to avoid delay in treating suspected vasculitic or autoimmune causes of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.',\n",
       " 'Sweden has a long tradition of monitoring occurrence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in both animals and humans, but there currently is no organised and harmonized monitoring on carriage of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase (pAmpC), or methicillin-resistant coagulase positive staphylococci e.g. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) in dogs. The aim of the current study was therefore to determine the prevalence of ESBL/pAmpC producing Enterobacteriaceae and methicillin-resistant coagulase positive staphylococci in healthy dogs in Sweden, and to phenotypically and genotypically characterize any identified isolates. It was shown that 0.9% (95% confident interval 0.3â\\x80\\x932.7%) of the dogs (n = 325) carried multi-resistant ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, but that no methicillin-resistant coagulase positive staphylococci could be detected.

       " 'BACKGROUND: Hydrops fetalis as well as abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) are conditions that are associated with high mortality rates. A rare case of immature gastric teratoma causing fetal hydrops and subsequent ACS is presented. The related pathophysiologic mechanisms are discussed, and the importance of timely recognition and appropriate interventions are highlighted. CASE PRESENTATION: The male patient was born preterm, weighing 3.9 kg., by Cesarean section. Prior prenatal ultrasounds were normal, but a scan done just before delivery had findings indicating polyhydramnios, fetal ascites, and meconium peritonitis. Upon delivery, the patient had respiratory distress, anasarca and a massively distended abdomen. Resuscitation measures, including ventilatory support, were instituted. Imaging studies showed ascites as well as a large, complex intra-abdominal lesion with calcifications. In the succeeding hours, anuria persisted, anasarca worsened, the abdomen became more distended, and inotrope requirements increased. The occurrence of ACS, from what was presumed to be a retroperitoneal teratoma, was therefore considered. Laparotomy was done on the 28th hour of life, with en bloc excision of a massive tumor and attached section of the greater curvature of the stomach. Passage of urine occurred intra-operatively, and the patient was soon after weaned off inotropes and ventilator support. The histopathologic result was immature gastric teratoma. No chemotherapy was given, and the patientâ\\x80\\x99s serum AFP is at normal levels 15 months following surgery. CONCLUSION: The presence of a massive intra-abdominal lesion can result in the pathophysiologic continuum of hydrops fetalis and neonatal ACS. The early recognition of such an association can enable appropriate expectant management of similarly affected neonates, including emergent decompression laparotomy.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is one of the leading causes of intensive care unit admission and is associated with high mortality. Noninvasive oxygenation strategies such as high-flow nasal cannula, standard oxygen therapy, and noninvasive ventilation (delivered by either face mask or helmet interface) are widely available interventions applied in these patients. It remains unclear which of these interventions are more effective in decreasing rates of invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality. The primary objective of this network meta-analysis is to summarize the evidence and compare the effect of noninvasive oxygenation strategies on mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. METHODS: We will search key databases for randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of noninvasive oxygenation strategies in adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. We will exclude studies in which the primary focus is either acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality (longest available up to 90 days). The secondary outcomes will be receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation (longest available up to 30 days). We will assess the risk of bias for each of the outcomes using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Bayesian network meta-analyses will be conducted to obtain pooled estimates of head-to-head comparisons. We will report pairwise and network meta-analysis treatment effect estimates as risk ratios and 95% credible intervals. Subgroup analyses will be conducted examining key populations including immunocompromised hosts. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted by excluding those studies with high risk of bias and different etiologies of acute respiratory failure. We will assess certainty in effect estimates using GRADE methodology. DISCUSSION: This study will help to guide clinical decision-making when caring for adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and improve our understanding of the limitations of the available literature assessing noninvasive oxygenation strategies in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Our aim was to identify if there are clinical differences in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis between 0â\\x80\\x936 months and 6â\\x80\\x9312 months of age. A secondary aim was to establish whether there was differences in terms of recurrent wheezing at 12, 24, and 36 months of follow-up. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinical and virological records of 824 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis during 11 consecutive epidemic seasons. From each infant at admission to the hospital nasopharyngeal washing was collected, clinical severity was assessed and clinical data were extracted from a structured questionnaire. At 12â\\x80\\x9324â\\x80\\x9336 months after discharge, parents were interviewed seeking information on recurrent wheezing. Results: A total of 773 infants (Group1) were â\\x89¤6 months of age, while 51 were >6 months (Group 2). No differences between family history for atopy and passive smoking exposure were observed between the two groups. Respiratory syncyzial virus was detected more frequently in Group 1 and human bocavirus in Group 2. The clinical severity score (p = 0.011) and the use of intravenous fluids (p = 0.0001) were higher in Group 1 with respect to Group 2 infants.

       " 'Rural amenity migration, or the relocation for quality of life purposes as opposed to monetary enhancement, has been occurring for decades and has been particularly pronounced in the American West where the phenomenon peaked in the 1990s. Researchers have illustrated that some places are more attractive for migrants than others and that certain regional amenities hold considerable influence on where migrants relocate. Increased migration levels typically result in increased economic growth indicators, making amenity migration an attractive rural development strategy. But comprehensive econometric analysis focused on amenity migration in the American West has been lacking. To address this, we conducted an econometric analysis of attributes that influenced migration to rural Western counties from 1980 to 2010. Over 20 potential amenity supply categories were collated for 356 rural counties from 11 Western states, with a focus on public lands. Descriptive statistics and OLS regressions were estimated and interpreted. Traditional amenities of climate, water area, and regional access were highly associated with migration levels, while designated natural amenities of Wilderness and National Monuments were the most influential public lands for migration to rural Western counties. Farming and oil and gas dependency were negatively associated with migration levels. Increasing the amount of protected areas, and branding campaigns based on natural amenities, can be a critical development strategy for rural communities.',\n",

This paper reviews the state of Americaâ\\x80\\x99s children and families, highlighting the influence of stressful contextual and social conditions on child and family well-being and the concentration of disadvantage in numerous neighborhoods and communities throughout the nation. It then briefly reviews the progress that has been made in pinpointing policies that can reduce stressful contextual conditions such as poverty, discrimination, and the marketing of unhealthful foods and substances. It also describes numerous family and school interventions that have proven benefit in preventing psychological and behavioral problems as diverse as tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use; depression; antisocial behavior; academic failure; obesity prevention; and early childbearing. We argue that progress in translating existing knowledge into widespread benefit will require a nationwide effort to intervene comprehensively in neighborhoods and communities of concentrated disadvantage. We present a strategic plan for how such an effort could be organized. The first step in this organizing would be the creation of a broad and diverse coalition of organizations concerned with advancing public health and well-being. Such a coalition could increase public support both for the policies needed to focus on these disadvantaged areas and the research needed to incrementally improve our ability to help these areas.',\n",

We hypothesized that the antibody and T cell-mediated immune responses (T-CMI) of elderly adults to a vaccine intended for intramuscular (IM) administration would be attenuated when deposited into SC fat, independent of confounding conditions. RESULTS: Fifty-two healthy, community dwelling elderly adults (65â\\x80\\x9382 years), seronegative for HBV, were enrolled in the SENIEUR protocol as a strictly healthy population. These seniors were randomized to receive a licensed alum-adjuvanted recombinant HBV vaccine either SC or IM, with the inoculum site verified by imaging. The response rates, defined as hepatitis B surface antibodies (HBsAb) â\\x89¥10 IU/L, were significantly lower in the elderly than in young adults, a group of 12, healthy, 21â\\x80\\x9334-year-old volunteers. Moreover, elderly participants who received the vaccine IM were significantly more likely to be responders than those immunized SC (54% versus 16%, p = 0.008). The low seroconversion rate in the IM group progressively declined with increasing age, and responders had significantly lower HBsAb titers and limited isotype responses. Moreover, T-CMI (proliferation and cytokine production) were significantly reduced in both percentage of responders and intensity of the response for both Th1 and Th2 subsets in the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the blunted immunogenicity of SC inoculation as measured by peak titers and response rates. Further, the qualitative and quantitative deficits in B- and T-CMI responses to primary alum adjuvanted protein antigens persisted even in strictly healthy elderly populations with verified IM placement compared to younger populations.

       " 'INTRODUCTION: Influenza in hospitalized intensive care unit (ICU) patients with respiratory failure is associated with 25% mortality, despite timely oseltamivir treatment. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alternative neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) regimens compared to standard of care in patients hospitalized for H1N1, H3N2, or B influenza. METHODS: The Cochrane collaboration searching methods were followed in Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science databases (2009â\\x80\\x932019). Eligibility criteria were RCTs comparing different regimens of NAIs in hospitalized patients (at least 1 year old) for clinically diagnosed influenza (H1N1, H3N2, or B). Pre-defined endpoints were time to clinical resolution (TTCR), overall mortality, hospital discharge, viral clearance, drug-related adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events. RESULTS: Seven trials (1579 patients) were included. Two trials compared two regimens of oral oseltamivir therapy, and one trial compared two regimens of intravenous zanamivir therapy vs oral oseltamivir therapy. Four trials focused on intravenous peramivir therapy: two trials compared two different regimens and two trials compared two different regimens vs oral oseltamivir therapy. Overall, the different regimens were well tolerated, with no significant differences in AEs; nonetheless non-significant differences were reported among different regimens regarding TTCR, mortality, and viral clearance. CONCLUSION: Higher compared to standard doses of NAIs or systemic peramivir therapy compared to oral oseltamivir therapy did not demonstrate benefit.

       " 'OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of ultra-low dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in women with breast cancer receiving nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) and experiencing treatment-related vulvovaginal symptoms and signs. METHODS: Women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer receiving NSAIs were randomized to either estriol vaginal gel or placebo for 12 weeks. Vaginal maturation, vaginal pH, and total and individual scores of symptoms and signs of vulvovaginal atrophy were assessed at baseline and at weeks 3 and 12; sexual functioning was also evaluated using the Female Sexual Functioning Index (FSFI) questionnaire, as well as circulating estrogens, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). RESULTS: Sixty-one women with a mean age of 59 years were included: 50 received 0.005% estriol vaginal gel and 11 received placebo. Active treatment significantly improved maturation value and pH, vaginal dryness and global scores of symptoms and signs. Active treatment also increased the total FSFI score and all the FSFI domains, with the exception of pain. Small oscillations were observed in FSH and LH, which remained within the postmenopausal range. Estriol levels increased initially and normalized by week 12, and estradiol and estrone remained mostly undetectable throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: Ultra-low dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel showed efficacy in improving the symptoms and signs of vulvovaginal atrophy. These results, together with minimal oscillations in hormonal levels throughout the treatment, support the use of ultra-low dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel as a treatment option for vulvovaginal atrophy in women with breast cancer receiving NSAIs with an indication for treatment with vaginal estrogens.',\n",

This study assessed the effect of HT on sarcopenia in postmenopausal women. METHODS: The present study included 4,254 postmenopausal women who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys from 2008 to 2011. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by weight (ASM/Wt) and the prevalence of sarcopenia were analyzed in groups of women stratified by duration of HT use. RESULTS: ASM/Wt was higher and the prevalence of sarcopenia was lower in participants with a history of prolonged (â\\x89¥13 mo) HT use than in participants with a shorter duration of HT use or no HT use. After adjusting for multiple confounding factors, prolonged use of HT remained significantly associated with estimated mean ASM/Wt and the prevalence of sarcopenia (odds ratio: 0.60; 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.88; P = 0.01). In addition, the prevalence of sarcopenia was linearly associated with history of hypertension, duration of hypertension, physical activity, and duration of HT use. Subgroup analysis showed that the association between duration of HT use and the prevalence of sarcopenia was maintained in younger (<65 y old) and leaner (body mass index <25 kg/m(2)) postmenopausal women.

These peptides were tested in a large randomized trial to assess their ability to prevent recurrence in HER2 expressing breast cancer patients. The primary analyses found no difference in 5-year overall disease-free survival (DFS) but possible benefit in subgroups. Here, we present the final landmark analysis. METHODS: In this 4-arm, prospective, randomized, single-blinded, multi-center phase II trial, disease-free node positive and high-risk node negative breast cancer patients enrolled after standard of care therapy. Six monthly inoculations of vaccine (VG) vs. control (CG) were given as the primary vaccine series with 4 boosters at 6-month intervals. Demographic, safety, immunologic, and DFS data were evaluated. RESULTS: 456 patients were enrolled; 154 patients in the VG and 147 in CG for AE37, 89 patients in the VG and 91 in CG for GP2. The AE37 arm had no difference in DFS as compared to CG, but pre-specified exploratory subgroup analyses showed a trend towards benefit in advanced stage (p = 0.132, HR 0.573 CI 0.275â\\x80\\x931.193), HER2 under-expression (p = 0.181, HR 0.756 CI 0.499â\\x80\\x931.145), and triple-negative breast cancer (p = 0.266, HR 0.443 CI 0.114â\\x80\\x931.717). In patients with both HER2 under-expression and advanced stage, there was significant benefit in the VG (p = 0.039, HR 0.375 CI 0.142â\\x80\\x930.988) as compared to CG. The GP2 arm had no significant difference in DFS as compared to CG, but on subgroup analysis, HER2 positive patients had no recurrences with a trend toward improved DFS (p = 0.052) in VG as compared to CG. CONCLUSIONS: This phase II trial reveals that AE37 and GP2 are safe and possibly associated with improved clinical outcomes of DFS in certain subgroups of breast cancer patients. With these findings, further evaluations are warranted of AE37 and GP2 vaccines given in combination and/or separately for specific subsets of breast cancer patients based on their disease biology.',\n",

Recent studies have shown that vitamin B1 (V(B)(1)) and vitamin C (Vc) can inhibit Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth, but the precise mechanism is still not well understood. In the present study, we have used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to analyze the transcriptional, metabolic and methylation profiles of Mycobacterium bovis BCG when treated with V(B)(1) and Vc. Our results show that, after vitamin treatment, variant metabolites were mainly clustered in pathways related to amino acid metabolism. Treatment with both vitamins significantly up-regulated the gene encoding cysteine synthase A. Additionally, only BCG that was treated with V(C) showed m4c modifications. Genes harboring this methylation were up-regulated, suggesting that m4c methylation can promote gene transcription to some extent. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of the effects of V(B)(1) and V(C), and suggests that these vitamins constitute potential anti-tuberculosis drugs.',\n",

Chloroquine (CQ) and bafilomycin A1 (BafA) each cause alkalinisation of the lumen and thus impair lysosomal function, although by distinct mechanisms. CQ diffuses into lysosomes and undergoes protonation, while BafA inhibits the ability of the vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase (v-ATPase) to transfer protons into the lysosome. In the present study, we examine the impact of CQ and BafA on the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), inhibition of which is an early step in promoting autophagy. We find each compound inhibits mTORC1 signalling, without affecting levels of protein components of the mTORC1 signalling pathway. Furthermore, these effects are not related to these agentsâ\\x80\\x99 capacity to inhibit autophagy or the reduction in amino acid supply from lysosomal proteolysis. Instead, our data indicate that the reduction in mTORC1 signalling appears to be due to the accumulation of lysosomal storage material. However, there are differences in responses to these agents, for instance, in their abilities to up-regulate direct targets of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a substrate of mTORC1 that drives transcription of many lysosomal and autophagy-related genes. Nonetheless, our data imply that widely used agents that alkalinise intralysosomal pH are mimetics of acute lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) and emphasise the importance of considering the result of CQ and BafA on mTORC1 signalling when interpreting the effects of these agents on cellular physiology.',\n",
       " 'BACKGROUND: Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are daunting environments for physiotherapy (PT) students performing clinical rotations. To prepare students for this environment, a newly developed, evidence-based e-learning module was designed and implemented in the undergraduate curriculum. The aim of this study was to investigate whether e-learning is a feasible method in preparing PT students for clinical work in complex ICU environments, as perceived by students and experts. METHODS: A mixed methods proof of concept study was undertaken. Participants were final-year students of an international curriculum, and experts from didactic and clinical fields. An e-learning module consisting of 7 separate chapters based on the latest scientific evidence and clinical expertise was developed, piloted and incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum as a compulsory course to be completed prior to clinical ICU rotations. Data were collected through 3 focus group meetings and 5 semi-structured interviews; these meetings and interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed. RESULTS: The study sample comprised of 14 students and 5 experts. Thematic analysis revealed three themes: expected competencies of PT students in ICU, feeling prepared for ICU clinical work and dealing with local variety. The e-learning module enabled students to anticipate clinical situations and PT tasks in the ICU. Higher level clinical reasoning skills, handling of lines and wires and dealing with out-of-textbook situations could not be achieved with the e-learning module alone. CONCLUSIONS: An e-learning module can sufficiently prepare PT students for their clinical tasks in the ICU, as long as it is integrated with, or closely connected to, the studentsâ\\x80\\x99 clinical placement.',\n",
       " \"In critical illness, homeostatic corrections representing the culmination of hundreds of millions of years of evolution, are modulated by the activated glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GRÎ±) and are associated with an enormous bioenergetic and metabolic cost. Appreciation of how homeostatic corrections work and how they evolved provides a conceptual framework to understand the complex pathobiology of critical illness. Emerging literature place the activated GRÎ± at the center of all phases of disease development and resolution, including activation and re-enforcement of innate immunity, downregulation of pro-inflammatory transcription factors, and restoration of anatomy and function. By the time critically ill patients necessitate vital organ support for survival, they have reached near exhaustion or exhaustion of neuroendocrine homeostatic compensation, cell bio-energetic and adaptation functions, and reserves of vital micronutrients. We review how critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency, mitochondrial dysfunction/damage, and hypovitaminosis collectively interact to accelerate an anti-homeostatic active process of natural selection. Importantly, the allostatic overload imposed by these homeostatic corrections impacts negatively on both acute and long-term morbidity and mortality. Since the bioenergetic and metabolic reserves to support homeostatic corrections are time-limited, early interventions should be directed at increasing GRÎ± and mitochondria number and function. Present understanding of the activated GC-GRÎ±'s role in immunomodulation and disease resolution should be taken into account when re-evaluating how to administer glucocorticoid treatment and co-interventions to improve cellular responsiveness. The activated GRÎ± interdependence with functional mitochondria and three vitamin reserves (B1, C, and D) provides a rationale for co-interventions that include prolonged glucocorticoid treatment in association with rapid correction of hypovitaminosis.\",\n",

       " 'Systemic treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has revolutionized the treatment of hematological and oncological diseases in recent years. The mechanism of action hinges on enhancing the natural ability of the immune system to eliminate malignant cells. The most important substances in this arena include inhibitors of PDâ\\x80\\x911, PD-L1 and CTLAâ\\x80\\x914. As a consequence, the spectrum of treatment-associated adverse reactions is shifting away from classical cytotoxic effects (e.g. pancytopenia and polyneuropathy) towards novel entities of immune-mediated complex diseases. These so-called immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can involve any organ system and mimic known classical autoimmune conditions. Timely recognition of irAEs is the key for rapid initiation of a suitable treatment and is especially challenging in the clinical routine as it requires an intensive interdisciplinary management. Nephrologists are particularly confronted with this kind of problem due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of their work. This article summarizes the broad spectrum of currently known renal and more frequently occuring non-renal forms of irAEs and aims to prime the reader on diagnostic and therapeutic options.',\n",
       " 'Despite being similar in structure, functioning, and size, viral pathogens enjoy very different, usually well-defined ways of life. They occupy their hosts for a few days (influenza), for a few weeks (measles), or even lifelong (HCV), which manifests in acute or chronic infections. The various transmission routes (airborne, via direct physical contact, etc.), degrees of infectiousness (referring to the viral load required for transmission), antigenic variation/immune escape and virulence define further aspects of pathogenic lifestyles. To survive, pathogens must infect new hosts; the success determines their fitness. Infection happens with a certain likelihood during contact of hosts, where contact can also be mediated by vectors. Besides structural aspects of the host-contact network, three parameters appear to be key: the contact rate and the infectiousness during contact, which encode the mode of transmission, and third the immunity of susceptible hosts. On these grounds, what can be said about the reproductive success of viral pathogens? This is the biological question addressed in this paper. The answer extends earlier results of the author and makes explicit connection to another basic work on the evolution of pathogens. A mathematical framework is presented that models intra- and inter-host dynamics in a minimalistic but unified fashion covering a broad spectrum of viral pathogens, including those that cause flu-like infections, childhood diseases, and sexually transmitted infections. These pathogens turn out as local maxima of numerically simulated fitness landscapes. The models involve differential and integral equations, agent-based simulation, networks, and probability.',\n",

       " 'INTRODUCTION: Emergency airway management of critically ill children in the Emergency Department (ED) is associated with the risk of intubation-related desaturation, which can be minimized by apneic oxygenation. We evaluated the use of apneic oxygenation in the pediatric ED and reported a quality improvement initiative to incorporate apneic oxygenation as a routine standard of care during rapid sequence intubations (RSIs). METHODS: A baseline period from June 2016 to April 2017 highlighted the practice gaps. Quality improvement interventions were subsequently developed and implemented as a care bundle consisting of a pre-intubation checklist, placing reminders and additional oxygen source in resuscitation bays, incorporating into the responsibilities of the airway doctor and the airway nurse (copiloting), education during airway workshops and simulation training for doctors and nurses, as well as enhancing documentation of the intubation process. We monitored a post-intervention observation period from May 2017 to April 2018 for the effectiveness of the care bundle. RESULTS: Apneic oxygenation was not performed in all 22 RSIs during the baseline period. Among 25 RSIs in the post-intervention observation period, providers performed apneic oxygenation in 17 (68%) cases. There was no significant difference in the utilization of apneic oxygenation among emergency physicians and pediatric anesthetists performing RSIs in the pediatric ED. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully implemented a care bundle targeted at incorporating apneic oxygenation as a routine standard of care during emergency intubations performed in ED. This method could be adopted by other pediatric EDs to improve airway management in critically ill children.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Bedside nurse (RN) presence during family-centered rounds (FCR) enhances communication and collaboration for safer, higher-quality care.1â\\x80\\x933 At our institution, RN participation in FCR was variable and lower than desired. The content discussed at each bedside during rounds was inconsistent, contributing to the irregular achievement of established FCR checklist items. METHODS: Using a scheduling tool with a prioritization algorithm and set time allotment/patient, we implemented schedule-based family-centered rounds (SBFCR) on a pediatric acute care unit. Primary outcome metrics included RN attendance and participation. We tracked rounding checklist compliance, parent presence on rounds, and adherence to the schedule. Surveys provided information on provider and family satisfaction. Perceived impact on teaching was the balancing measure because the structure discouraged spending extra time at the cost of team tardiness for the next patient. RESULTS: We created a schedule for 95% workweek days, with the rounding order kept for 93%. Mean RN attendance increased from 69% to 87% and participation increased from 48% to 80% with SBFCR (P < 0.001 for each). FCR checklist compliance increased from 60% to 94% (P < 0.001). Families felt more informed and able to attend; their presence at rounds rose from 66% to 85% (P < 0.001). Most faculty and trainees felt SBFCR was efficient and observed increased teaching with SBFCR. CONCLUSIONS: SBFCR provides an organizational framework for increased RN attendance and participation as well as greater family presence during rounds. The system elevated provider satisfaction with rounding without degrading the perceived educational experience.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Despite being a participating Solutions for Patient Safety (SPS) childrenâ\\x80\\x99s hospital and having attempted implementation of the SPS hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) prevention bundle, our hospital remained at a HAPI rate that was 3 times the mean for SPS participating childrenâ\\x80\\x99s hospitals. This performance led to the launch of an enterprise-wide HAPI reduction initiative in our organization. The purpose of this article is to describe the improvement initiative, the key drivers, and the resulting decrease in the SPS-reportable HAPI rate. METHODS: We designed a hospital-wide HAPI reduction initiative with actions grouped into 3 key driver areas: standardization, data transparency, and accountability. We paused all individual hospital unit-based HAPI reduction initiatives. We calculated the rate of SPS-reportable HAPIs per 1,000 patient days during both the pre- and postimplementation phases and compared mean rates using a 2-sided t test assuming unequal variances. RESULTS: The mean SPS-reportable HAPI rate for the preimplementation phase was 0.3489, and the postimplementation phase was 0.0609. The difference in rates was statistically significant (P < 0.00032). This result equates to an 82.5% reduction in HAPI rate. CONCLUSIONS: Having an institutional pause and retooled initiative to reduce HAPI with key drivers in the areas of standardization, data transparency, and accountability had a statistically significant reduction in our organizationâ\\x80\\x99s SPS-reportable HAPI rate.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Virtual reality (VR) is an emerging tool for anxiety and fear reduction in pediatric patients. VR use is facilitated by Certified Child Life Specialists (CCLS) at pediatric hospitals. The primary aim of this study was to retrospectively review the safety of VR by analyzing adverse events after the utilization of VR under CCLS supervision. Secondary objectives were to characterize the efficacy of VR in enhancing patient cooperation, describe the integration of VR into Child Life services, and identify interventions that accompanied VR. METHODS: The Stanford Chariot Program developed VR applications, customized VR interfaces, and patient head straps, and distributed these to CCLS. Chart review analyzed VR utilization through CCLS patient notes. Inclusion criteria were all patients ages 6 to 18-years-old who received a Child Life intervention. RESULTS: From June 2017 to July 2018, 31 CCLS saw 8,098 patients, 3,696 of which met age criteria with pre- and post-intervention cooperation data. Two hundred thirteen patients received VR with an accompanying intervention, while 34 patients received only VR. Adverse events were rare, and included increased anxiety (3.8%, n=8), dizziness (0.5%, n=1), and nausea (0.5%, n=1). Patients were more likely to be cooperative after receiving VR (99.5%, n=212) compared to pre-intervention (96.7%, n=206, p=0.041). VR use was most common in the perioperative setting (60%, n=128), followed by outpatient clinics (15%, n=32). CONCLUSION: VR is safe in pediatric patients with appropriate hardware, software, and patient selection. Side effects were rare and self-limited. VR appears to be associated with improvements in cooperation.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: PediPlace, a busy pediatric not-for-profit clinic in Lewisville, Tex., struggles with prolonged patient wait times. This quality improvement (QI) project aimed to reduce appointment lengths and improve the patient experience. METHODS: PediPlace introduced 3 interventions: improved patient tracking to measure timing on the electronic health record interface, elimination of script repetition between medical assistants and providers, and patient art kits. RESULTS: From over 2,000 surveys indicated that patients were more satisfied; the percentage of negative survey comments decreased from 20% in 2017 and 2018 to under 10% in 2019. The overall rating of the clinic rose from 3.8 to 4.75 (on a scale of 1â\\x80\\x935) after QI interventions as well. The number of patients not checked out declined from 49 errors in Octoberâ\\x80\\x93December 2018 to 25 errors in Januaryâ\\x80\\x93March 2019, indicating that this part of the initiative was initially successful. However, subsequent months experienced higher error rates. Analysis of over 20,000 appointments from June 2018 to July 2019 showed that appointment length did not change after interventions. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in appointment lengths between Hispanic/Latino patients and other patients, and an encouraging finding that suggests PediPlace providers are effective bilingual communicators. Furthermore, anecdotal evidence indicated that the art kits were positively received. The interventions appeared to improve the patient experience but did not impact appointment length. PediPlace plans to continue QI initiatives in the future.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. Common allergy clinic procedures, including oral food challenges and subcutaneous immunotherapy, carry a risk of anaphylaxis, the treatment for which is epinephrine. Our goal was to develop a standardized process for the management and documentation of allergic reactions that occur in a tertiary care pediatric allergy clinic. METHODS: This was a single institution quality improvement pilot study. A multidisciplinary team from the allergy department designed, implemented, and studied the use of a standardized form for the documentation and treatment of allergic reactions within the clinic. RESULTS: A standardized form was developed based on evidence-based guidelines for the management of allergic reactions and included space for documentation. Both clinic providers and staff approved the form. One year after the introduction, we reached 100% adherence for the use of the form in visits during which a patient experienced a severe allergic reaction requiring epinephrine. Two patients required transfer to the emergency room; the quality improvement form was utilized in these cases to document treatment and assist with the hand-off to emergency room personnel before transfer. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully implemented a standardized form for the treatment and documentation of anaphylaxis within our allergy clinic. The next steps focus on further integrating this form into the electronic medical record, determining compliance with evidence-based management of anaphylaxis, and formally assessing the use of the form as a handoff tool in the event of patient transfer.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Meaningful conversations about diagnostic errors require safety cultures where clinicians are comfortable discussing errors openly. However, clinician comfort discussing diagnostic errors publicly and barriers to these discussions remain unexplored. We compared cliniciansâ\\x80\\x99 comfort discussing diagnostic errors to other medical errors and identified barriers to open discussion. METHODS: Pediatric clinicians at 4 hospitals were surveyed between May and June 2018. The survey assessed respondentsâ\\x80\\x99 comfort discussing medical errors (with varying degrees of system versus individual clinician responsibility) during morbidity and mortality conferences and privately with peers. Respondents reported the most significant barriers to discussing diagnostic errors publicly. Poststratification weighting accounted for nonresponse bias; the Benjaminiâ\\x80\\x93Hochberg adjustment was applied to control for false discovery (significance set at P < 0.018). RESULTS: Clinicians (n = 838; response rate 22.6%) were significantly less comfortable discussing all error types during morbidity and mortality conferences than privately (P < 0.004) and significantly less comfortable discussing diagnostic errors compared with other medical errors (P < 0.018). Comfort did not differ by clinician type or years in practice; clinicians at one institution were significantly less comfortable discussing diagnostic errors compared with peers at other institutions. The most frequently cited barriers to discussing diagnostic errors publicly included feeling like a bad clinician, loss of reputation, and peer judgment of knowledge base and decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians are more uncomfortable discussing diagnostic errors than other types of medical errors. The most frequent barriers involve the public perception of clinical performance. Addressing this aspect of safety culture may improve clinician participation in efforts to reduce harm from diagnostic errors.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: The risk of lights and sirens use in emergency medical services has been well documented. Our critical care transport team performs over 1,800 interfacility nonemergency medical services transports annually into a dense urban environment. Historically, we have utilized lights and sirens to navigate traffic patterns. The use exceeded industry standards. This quality improvement project was undertaken to decrease the use of lights and sirens. METHODS/RESULTS: The baseline use of lights and sirens in 2011 was 76% en route and 73% on return to the facility. We revised the internal policy guiding the appropriate usage of lights and sirens. In 2012, without an improvement in usage, a use justification process was implemented. By 2013, the use of lights and sirens was still high en route, but had decreased to 53% on the return trip. In 2014, we added accountability measures requiring justification, with a subsequent drop in 2015 to 14% en route and 13% on return. In the following 3 years, the transport teams have sustained lights and sirens use to 20% or below. CONCLUSIONS: This quality improvement initiative impacted team behavior and decreased the use of lights and sirens over 5 years, with sustained improvement at or below 20%. This improvement was accomplished through ongoing evaluation, education, data gathering, and open communication. There was no negative impact on patient outcomes during this time. Lights and sirens continue to be used when indicated.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Direct hospital admission of children without evaluation in the emergency department (ED) is common, but few guidelines exist to maximize safety by assessing patient stability. This report describes a novel approach to support patient safety. METHODS: An interdisciplinary childrenâ\\x80\\x99s hospital team developed a brief ED-based evaluation process called the ED Rapid Assessment of Patients Intended for Inpatient Disposition (ED RAPID). It entails a brief evaluation of vital signs and clinical stability by the ED attending physician and nurse. Children deemed stable are admitted to inpatient wards, whereas those requiring immediate intervention undergo full ED evaluation and disposition. We assessed outcomes for all children evaluated through this process from March 2013 through February 2015. RESULTS: During the study period, we identified 715 patients undergoing ED RAPID evaluation. Of these, we directly admitted 691 (96.4%) to the hospital ward after ED RAPID evaluation; median ED treatment time was 4.0 minutes. We transitioned 24 (3.4%) to full ED evaluation, 14 (2.0%) because a ward bed was unavailable, and 10 (1.4%) for clinical reasons identified in the evaluation. We admitted four of the 10 stopped (40% of stops, 0.6% of total) to an intensive care unit, and 6 (60% of stops, 0.8% of total) to the hospital ward after ED care. Eight children (1.1%) admitted to the hospital ward after ED RAPID evaluation required a transfer to an intensive care unit within 12 hours. CONCLUSION: The ED RAPID evaluation process for children directly admitted to the hospital was feasible and effective in this setting.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Pediatric early warning scores (PEWS) identify hospitalized children at risk for deterioration. Manual calculation is prone to human error. Electronic health records (EHRs) enable automated calculation, removing human error. This studyâ\\x80\\x99s objective was to compare the accuracy of automated EHR-based PEWS calculation (AutoPEWS) to manual calculation and evaluate the non-inferiority of AutoPEWS in predicting deterioration. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study inclusive of non-intensive care unit inpatients at a freestanding childrenâ\\x80\\x99s hospital over 4.5 months in Fall 2018. AutoPEWS mapped the historical manual PEWS scoring rubric to frequently used EHR documentation. We determined accuracy by comparing the expected respiratory subset score based on the current respiratory rate to the actual respiratory score of AutoPEWS and the manual PEWS. The agreement was determined using kappa statistics. We used predicted probabilities from a generalized linear mixed model to calculate areas under the curve for each combination of scores (AutoPEWS, manual) and deterioration outcome (rapid response team activation, unplanned intensive care unit transfer, critical deterioration event). We compared the adjusted difference in areas under the curves between the scores. Non-inferiority was defined as a difference of <0.05. RESULTS: There were 23,514 total PEWS representative of 5,384 patients. AutoPEWS respiratory scores were 99.97% accurate, while the manual PEWS respiratory scores were 86% accurate. AutoPEWS were higher overall than the manual PEWS (mean 0.65 versus 0.34). They showed a fair-to-good agreement (weighted kappa 0.42). Non-inferiority of AutoPEWS compared with the manual PEWS was demonstrated for all deterioration outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Automation of PEWS calculation improved accuracy without sacrificing predictive ability.',\n",
       " 'OBJECTIVE: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis has an overall mortality rate of 11%â\\x80\\x9329% with treatment. Although rare, HSV encephalitis is frequently tested for and empirically treated, especially in the neonatal population. HSV infection can be diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, although this frequently requires sending samples to reference laboratories. The inherent delay in results may lead to prolonging empiric treatment and hospital stay, resulting in increased costs. This study investigates whether onsite HSV PCR testing decreases hospitalization duration, acyclovir treatment duration, and financial cost on an institution. PROJECT DESIGN: This single-center project utilized the IHI model for improvement to evaluate third-party HSV PCR processing versus an implemented onsite PCR-based meningitisâ\\x80\\x93encephalitis panel for HSV central nervous system evaluation. The primary outcome was hospital cost differential with secondary outcomes, including duration of acyclovir administration and time to result. RESULTS: We identified 96 children age 0â\\x80\\x9318 from 2010 to 2016, 74 patients utilizing offsite third-party testing, and 22 patients utilizing onsite. We observed a per-patient cost savings of $428 ($618.43â\\x80\\x93$190.43, P = 0.029) upon the implementation of onsite testing. The mean duration of acyclovir therapy decreased from 3.7 to 0.26 days per patient (P < 0.001). Time to result decreased from 4.6 to 0.13 days (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Acquisition of real-time local HSV PCR capabilities significantly decreased time to result and empiric medication use while significantly reducing hospital costs in a military treatment facility.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) is associated with a decreased risk for chronic lung disease (CLD) in preterm neonates. This report examined the effectiveness of adopting bCPAP to reduce respiratory complications and medication usage in a community hospital NICU. METHODS: The efficacy of bCPAP was assessed by retrospective examination and comparison of 45 neonates who received bCPAP and 87 neonates who received conventional ventilation only. Data on medication usage were also collected and analyzed. RESULTS: After introduction of the bCPAP protocol, the median number of days on oxygen decreased in the bCPAP group compared with the conventional ventilation only group (median = 33 days, IQR = 7.5â\\x80\\x9366 vs median = 0, IQR = 0â\\x80\\x930; P < 0.001). The exposure to conventional ventilation decreased in the bCPAP group compared with the conventional ventilation only group (median = 18 days, IQR = 5â\\x80\\x9342.5 vs median = 0, IQR = 0â\\x80\\x937; P < 0.001). Postimplementation of bCPAP revealed decreases in CLD from 26 (30%) in the conventional ventilation only group to 2 (4%) in the bCPAP group (P = 0.002); there was also a significant decrease in the use of sedative medications in the bCPAP group compared with the conventional ventilation only group (mean = 5.20 doses, SD = 31.97 vs mean = 1.43, SD = 9.98; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The use of bCPAP results in significant decreases in the use of conventional ventilation, the risk for CLD, and the need for sedative medication.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Pediatric hospital readmissions can represent gaps in care quality between discharge and follow-up, including social factors not typically addressed by hospitals. This study aimed to reduce the 30-day pediatric readmission rate on 2 general pediatric services through an intervention to enhance care spanning the hospital stay, discharge, and follow-up process. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team developed an intervention bundle based on a needs assessment and evidence-based models of transitional care. The intervention included pre-discharge planning with a transition coordinator, screening and intervention for adverse social determinants of health (SDH), medication reconciliation after discharge, communication with the primary care provider, access to a hospital-based transition clinic, and access to a 24-hour direct telephone line staffed by hospital attending pediatricians. These were implemented sequentially from October 2013 to February 2017. The primary outcome was the readmission rate within 30 days of index discharge. The length of stay was a balancing measure. RESULTS: During the intervention, the included services discharged 4,853 children. The pre-implementation readmission rate of 10.3% declined to 7.4% and remained stable during a 4-month post-intervention observation period. Among 1,394 families screened for adverse SDH, 48% reported and received assistance with â\\x89¥ 1 concern. The length of stay increased from 4.10 days in 2013 to 4.30 days in 2017. CONCLUSIONS: An intervention bundle, including SDH, was associated with a sustained reduction in readmission rates to 2 general pediatric services. Transitional care that addresses multiple domains of family need during a childâ\\x80\\x99s health crisis can help reduce pediatric readmissions.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: The dissemination of quality improvement (QI) interventions to a broader range of healthcare settings requires a proactive assessment of local work systems and processes. The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of using a survey-based work system assessment (WSA) tool to facilitate the dissemination of a program for optimizing blood culture (BC) use. METHODS: Informed by findings from an onsite, interview-based WSA at 2 hospitals, a 50-item WSA survey was devised and administrated to 15 hospitals participating in a QI collaborative. WSA survey data were summarized, shared, and discussed with individual hospitals to inform the adaptation and implementation of the BC program. Physician champions leading the local QI team assessed the use of the WSA survey by completing an 8-item survey. RESULTS: A total of 347 clinicians completed the WSA survey, and physician champions at 12 hospitals evaluated the use of the WSA survey. Both the WSA survey data and the evaluation of the WSA survey showed that the survey-based WSA tool could help participating hospitals understand their current BC ordering practices and identify potential barriers to implementing the program from the perspectives of different clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated how a survey-based tool could be used to facilitate WSA in the dissemination of a program for improving BC use to a multisite collaborative. A survey-based WSA tool can be used to facilitate future large-scale intervention dissemination efforts.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Healthcare costs are rising, and clinical pathways (CPW) are one means to promote high-value care by standardizing care and improving outcomes without compromising cost or quality. However, providers do not always follow CPW, and our understanding of their perceptions is limited. Our objective was to examine pediatric hospital medicine (PHM) and pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) physician perspectives of CPW. METHODS: We conducted semistructured, in-depth, one-on-one qualitative interviews with PHM and PEM physicians between February 2017 and August 2017. Interviews were audio-recorded, professionally transcribed, and accuracy verified. Using an inductive analytic strategy, we systematically coded the data to identify themes. RESULTS: We interviewed 15 PHM and 15 PEM physicians. These providers identified many benefits and limitations of CPW, which positively or negatively impact resource utilization, communication, education of personnel, patients, and families, as well as practice behaviors and attitudes. Perceived benefits included (1) reduction of unnecessary utilization, (2) standardization of care, (3) improved communication, (4) education of oneself and others, and (5) confidence and validation when actions align with CPW. Limitations of CPW were (1) resource utilization for revisions, updates, and dissemination; (2) â\\x80\\x9ctunnel visionâ\\x80\\x9d and cognitive biases; (3) loss of autonomy; (4) prescriptive medicine; (5) information overload; (6) pressure to adhere; and (7) guilt if actions do not align with CPW. CONCLUSIONS: CPW are tools with advantages and disadvantages that are used and viewed differently by providers. Such insight into how physicians perceive CPW may help to optimize hospital improvement work and enhance high-value care.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Handoffs and transitions of care are common weak points in healthcare provider communication as patients move between sites. With no consistent pattern of communication between St. Jude Childrenâ\\x80\\x99s Research Hospital (St. Jude) and its affiliated clinics, the Affiliate Program Office at St. Jude developed and implemented a standardized communication tool to facilitate patient transitions between different healthcare sites. METHODS: Each team of providers created flow diagrams to define the current state of communication when patients were transitioning between remote sites. Fishbone diagrams identified the common barriers to effective communication as a lack of consistent communication and ownership. We developed a communication tool to address these barriers, which was disseminated by secure email. We measured the percent usage of the completed hand-off tool before a patient transitioned, staff experience, and the number of errors. RESULTS: The time to send or receive the communication bundle was <10 minutes. Within 3 months of implementing the SMART bundle at 3 pilot sites, the bundle was used completely in 6 of 8 patient transitions and was associated with somewhat improved staff satisfaction. We identified no adverse events related to the communication bundle. CONCLUSIONS: In this small pilot study, we accomplished closed-loop communication between geographically remote healthcare sites by using an electronically transmitted standardized communication bundle.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests and emergent transfers to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) represent a serious patient safety concern with associated increased morbidity and mortality. Some institutions have turned to the electronic health record and predictive analytics in search of earlier and more accurate detection of patients at risk for decompensation. METHODS: Objective electronic health record data from 2011 to 2017 was utilized to develop an automated early warning system score aimed at identifying hospitalized children at risk of clinical deterioration. Five vital sign measurements and supplemental oxygen requirement data were used to build the Vitals Risk Index (VRI) model, using multivariate logistic regression. We compared the VRI to the hospitalâ\\x80\\x99s existing early warning system, an adaptation of Monaghanâ\\x80\\x99s Pediatric Early Warning Score system (PEWS). The patient population included hospitalized children 18 years of age and younger while being cared for outside of the ICU. This dataset included 158 case hospitalizations (102 emergent transfers to the ICU and 56 â\\x80\\x9ccode blueâ\\x80\\x9d events) and 135,597 control hospitalizations. RESULTS: When identifying deteriorating patients 2 hours before an event, there was no significant difference between Pediatric Early Warning Score and VRIâ\\x80\\x99s areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve at false-positive rates â\\x89¤ 10% (pAUC(10) of 0.065 and 0.064, respectively; P = 0.74), a threshold chosen to compare the 2 approaches under clinically tolerable false-positive rates. CONCLUSIONS: The VRI represents an objective, simple, and automated predictive analytics tool for identifying hospitalized pediatric patients at risk of deteriorating outside of the ICU setting.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Accurate and timely documentation of pediatric early warning scores (PEWS) by the bedside nurse into the electronic health record (EHR) is important to promote early identification of patients in stages of deterioration. Through the implementation of a PEWS calculator embedded in the EHR, we hope to improve the accuracy of the recorded score and reduce the time between vital sign collection and final documentation in the EHR. METHODS: Identification of the highest PEWS value in the 24 hours before all unplanned transfers or rapid response activations without a transfer occurred between the period November 1, 2013, through December 31, 2016. The accuracy of the calculated cardiac or respiratory subscore based on heart rate or the respiratory rate at the time of PEWS calculation was determined. We tracked the calculation of the time to chart via the difference between nursing documentation of PEWS compared to vital sign collection. Before September 3, 2015, PEWS was calculated mentally by the bedside nurse; afterward, the nurse entered the unique PEWS features into the EHR, and the EHR automatically calculated PEWS. RESULTS: This study evaluated 2,409 PEWS scores, 1,411 before and 998 after initiation of the PEWS calculator. Accuracy before the EHR calculator was 71%, and the median time to document was 55 minutes. Following the implementation of the calculator, no scores were incorrectly calculated too low, and the median time to document was 20 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Transition to an EHR-based PEWS calculator eliminated inaccurately low PEWS values and reduced time to document.',\n",
